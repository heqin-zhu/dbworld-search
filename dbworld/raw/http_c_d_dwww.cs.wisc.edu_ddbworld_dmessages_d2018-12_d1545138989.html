Workshop on Designing Crowd-powered Creativity Support Systems (DC2S2)
Web: https://dc2s2.github.io/2019/ 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In conjunction with CHI'19, 4th-9th May 2019, Glasgow, Scotland
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Workshop Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Supporting creativity has been considered as one of the grand challenges in Human Computer Interaction (HCI).  The goal of creativity support systems is to make "more people more creative more often".  By creativity, we refer to the process that leads to an artifact that is deemed both novel and useful in a given field and domain.  Crowdsourcing is the practice of outsourcing tasks on an online platform to a crowd of people via an open call for contributions.  Given the inherent emphasis of crowdsourcing in collecting insights rapidly, inexpensively and accurately, crowdsourcing has been suggested as a key approach for creativity support. Organizations have recognized the potential of crowds, with companies such as Innocentive, Quirky and OpenIDEO finding success in Open Innovation.

In this one-day workshop at the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI'19), we bring together scientists and practitioners interested in creativity.  We invite participants working on collaborative and crowd-powered systems that in one way or another enhance creative processes or challenge the academic community¡¯s thinking and perceptions about creativity in general.  Doing so, we set to inspire the design of next-generation crowd-powered systems that support creativity.  The workshop allows for participants to bring forward their ideas, designs and practical experiences in the field of supporting creativity through crowdsourcing.

Topics of Interest
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As creativity can be an attribute of individuals or teams, we will center the workshop around the following two themes as a broad estimate of the type of system designs that we hope to stimulate with the workshop: augmenting the individual, and supporting group collaboration. 
Two main themes of interest for this first workshop: (1) augmenting the individual, and (2) supporting group collaboration, topics include but are not limited to the following: 

* Augmenting the Individual
    - Interfaces and software for supporting peak-productive moments ("bursts") of an individual's creativity with the collective intelligence of the crowd
    - Preventing cognitive overload of the individual: Evaluating the quality of contributions from the crowd and helping explore the space of solutions contributed by the crowd

* Supporting Group Ideation
    - Determining levels of collaboration to prevent early fixation of the group without limiting the quality through feedback
    - Dynamically guiding crowd efforts based on task needs, worker profiles, etc.
    - Automating repetitive tasks in group ideation

Important Dates
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Tuesday February 1st, 2019: Position paper submission deadline
- Friday March 1st, 2019: Notification of Acceptance
- Friday March 15th, 2019: Camera-ready paper due 
- Saturday May 4th, 2019: Workshop day
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Submissions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Papers must comply with the ACM SIGCHI Extended Abstracts format:
-	Position papers (4 pages)

Submissions will be sent via email:
dc2s2workshop@oulu.fi

The review of submissions will follow a juried process (see chi2018.acm.org/selection-processes). A summary of the workshop will be made available on the workshop website. Further, the workshop
organizers and the authors of the contributions that were elected by the workshop participants for
the break-out brainstorming session will compose a joint article, to report on the workshop and its
outcomes, for publication in ACM Interactions.
At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop and all participants must register for both the workshop and for at least one day of the conference.
