*SCOPE*
The goal of the 1st International Workshop on Next Generation Clouds for Extreme Data Analytics (XtremeCLOUD) is to bring together researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to explore, discuss and possibly redefine the state of the art in Cloud Computing relative to heterogeneity, resource management, scalability, methods and tools applied over any part of algorithms and computing infrastructures, as well as use-cases and applications that relate to extreme data analytics. This workshop will solicit original research work on fundamental aspects of Cloud Computing that enable extreme scale data processing as well as the design, implementation and evaluation of novel tools and methods for optimizing Big Data applications and workflows. 

*TOPICS*
-Hardware-aware Big Data frameworks
-Benchmarking/modeling of performance/cost/energy consumption of resource demanding cloud applications on heterogeneous hardware
-Algorithms, methods and tools to improve the utilization and scalability of Cloud infrastructures
-Holistic and efficient management of Cloud resources
-Novel architectures and programming models for extreme scale data processing
-Extreme scale batch/streaming applications optimization 
-Scheduling algorithms and tools for heterogeneous execution
-Applications and use cases of Big Data analytics over heterogeneous architectures/hardware
-Visionary ideas on extreme data analytics and heterogeneous environments

*IMPORTANT DATES*
Submission deadline 每 October 8, 2018 (extended deadline)
Notification date 每 October 15, 2018
Camera-ready due 每 October 30, 2018
Workshop date 每 December 10, 2018

*SUBMISSION GUIDELINES*
Authors are invited to submit papers containing unpublished, original work (not under review elsewhere) of up to 6 pages of double column text using single spaced 10 point size on 8.5 x 11 inch pages, as per IEEE 8.5 x 11 manuscript guidelines.
