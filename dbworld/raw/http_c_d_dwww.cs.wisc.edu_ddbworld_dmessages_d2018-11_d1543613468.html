CALL FOR TUTORIALS

Each year the Non-Volatile Memories Workshop includes a tutorial afternoon that covers a topic in more depth.  Tutorials are typically 2-4 hours long and are a long-form presentation on the topic(s).   Previous tutorial topics have included:

Phase change memory
Signal processing for NVMs
Data integrity in storage stacks
RamCloud
Persistent memory programming

We invite proposals for the 2019 tutorial. 

Tutorial proposals should be between 1 and 3 pages and include a brief outline of the material to be covered, discussion of its relevance to the NVMW community, and the qualifications of the presenters.  The tutorial will be selected based on the timeliness and general interest of the topic to the NVMW community.

The submission deadline for tutorials is January 15, 2019.  Notifications will be out by January 22.  The tutorial will be held the afternoon of Sunday, March 10, 2019.

More information on the workshop is available at the workshop website (<a href="http://nvmw.ucsd.edu">http://nvmw.ucsd.edu</a>).
