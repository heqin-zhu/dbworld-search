Goals of the Workshop
=====================
Industrial enterprises currently address the challenge of transforming 
the ideas of the Internet of Things, Industry 4.0, Cyber-Physical 
Systems, and similar concepts into reality. A direct application of the 
IoT approach to the production chains in manufacturing companies is 
presently not feasible, as there are many more parameters, but much less 
available data compared to other big data application domains. Modern 
production is characterized by vast amounts of data. However, this data 
is neither easily accessible, interpretable, nor connected to gain 
knowledge. Digital twins are supposed to provide a digital 
representation of a production landscape, but the challenges in 
building, maintaining, optimizing, and evolving digital twins in 
inter-organizational production chains that cross several boundaries 
have not been addressed yet in a systematic manner. 

In this context, also various data management challenges have to be 
addressed. Huge amounts of heterogeneous sensor data (numerical, audio, 
video, etc.) have to be processed in real-time in order to control the 
production machines. In addition, unstructured data from production 
reports or external sources have also to be integrated to analyze and 
optimize the production process. Well established mathematical models 
for production engineering have to be integrated with data-driven 
machine learning for cross-domain knowledge generation. 

On the other hand, Industry 4.0 or the Industrial Internet of Things are 
the basis for new applications and business opportunities. By connecting 
physical objects, systems, machines, and applications, the data produced 
by these objects may become a valuable resource, i.e., a product in its 
own right. Thus, data management and analysis operations have to be 
linked questions about value creation within and across enterprises. 
These ideas raise new requirements in terms of trust, data security, and 
data sovereignty, which also have to be considered in data-oriented 
industrial applications. 

The workshop aims at bringing together researchers from different 
domains and to discuss the challenges for data science in industrial 
settings. The workshop will provide a forum for the presentation of 
recent research results, work-in-progress reports, vision papers, a 
panel discussion, and an attractive keynote speaker.

in a joint volume with other EDBT workshops. A special issue in an international journal is also
planned, best papers from the workshop will be invited to the special issue.

Submission Guidelines
=====================

DSI4 welcomes the full paper submission of original and previously unpublished research.
All submissions will be peer-reviewed and, once accepted, they will be included in the workshop proceedings.

* Full papers can be up to 8 pages in length including all figures, tables, and references and should be
  submitted as a PDF according to the EDBT format. The template can be found at
  <a href="http://edbticdt2019.inesc-id.pt/?EDBT_CFP">http://edbticdt2019.inesc-id.pt/?EDBT_CFP</a>

* We also encourage the submission of short papers (up to 4 pages) reporting work in progress.

* Full-length papers are accepted through the online submission system of the workshop.

* Submissions in PDF have to be uploaded to the workshop's EasyChair submission site:
