About the DECOR Workshop
-----

The Second Workshop on Data Engineering meets intelligent food and COoking Recipes (DECOR) aims to accelerate research in 
data science by providing a forum for the latest innovations in the intersection of Data Engineering and Intelligent Food 
and Cooking Recipes, concerning data and software organization, integration, and sharing.  This workshop is specifically 
focused on data science innovations that accelerate the integration, access, and sharing of digital objects in support of 
Intelligent Food and Cooking Recipes domain, which comprises not only the process of cooking, but also includes intelligent 
methods for enhancing human-food interactions, ranging from devising technology, playful interactions, multisensory 
experience design, understanding cross-cultural food eating habits and perception, as well as  food choices and health 
connections. Consequently, increasing the ability of influencing food eating habits and choices that promote, simultaneously, 
healthful eating-decisions and creative new human-food interaction experiences.

Special events:
Tentative Keynote Speakers (to be announced)
Enlightening Student session
Hackathon
Evening gastronomy tasting session


The goal of the workshop is to provide concrete contributions in developing model design, technologies and presenting intelligent 
data management tools supporting Intelligent Food and Cooking Recipes processes. Authors will be encouraged to submit contributions 
addressing a range of topics in the intersection of Data Sciences and Intelligence Food. In addition to primary investigations 
applying advanced analytic pipelines to data already stored in repositories, desirable contributions also include the reports of 
the full set of digital objects that are produced. These digital objects might include original data, software, software pipelines, 
models, workflows, containers, virtual machines, intermediary data, and metadata strategies.

DECOR 2019 invites authors to submit papers in one of the following types:
1. Long papers (no longer than 6 pages): Both theoretical and practical research papers from both research
and industrial communities addressing the main conference topic. For instance, we will consider contributions about
 DECOR application, case study, datasets.
2. Short papers (no longer than 4 pages): Position papers, open perspectives and challenging problems, or
interesting discussion topics in the DECOR field are welcome.
3. Students are also invited to submit long papers and short papers in the special enlightening student session.


All submissions must be prepared in the IEEE camera-ready format. Thank you for following the submission guidelines
