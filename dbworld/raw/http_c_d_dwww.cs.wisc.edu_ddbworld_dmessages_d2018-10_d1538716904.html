GENERAL INFORMATION:
We have witnessed fast developments of various artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, and many forms 
of information and communication systems with AI are becoming core parts of our daily lives. 
With the proliferation of future information, communication, and electronic devices, there is a fast growing 
interest in information and communication technology (ICT) with AI. The conference promotes their transfer 
into practical applications, for developing intelligent ICT systems and pursuing artificial intelligence applications 
for contents, platforms, networks and devices. The First International Conference on AI in information and 
communication (ICAIIC 2019) aims at addressing advances in research on ICT, covering topics ranging from 
ICT technology issues to emerging AI applications for ICTs. ICAIIC 2019 solicits original, unpublished 
contributions in all aspects of AI in information and communication. Submitted articles must not be 
concurrently considered elsewhere for publication. We also encourage authors to submit short papers on 
the early stages of research or development in progress, which present important new challenges. 
Position papers on new idea and industry papers are also welcome. The conference is organized by 
KICS (The Korean Institute of Communications and Information Sciences) with the technical co-sponsorship 
of IEEE Communications Society. Accepted and presented papers will be published in the ICAIIC Conference 
Proceedings with an assigned ISBN number and submitted to IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and EI Compendex. 
Also extended versions of selected papers will be published in the following international journals as 
a special section for the ICAIIC 2019.

The topics include, but are not limited to:
