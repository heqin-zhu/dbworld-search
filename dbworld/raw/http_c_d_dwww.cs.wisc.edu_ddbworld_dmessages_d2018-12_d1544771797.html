Special Issue on Artificial Intelligence-based Information Security

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has become very prominent in the area of Computers and Electrical Engineering (CEE) all across the world. The use of ICT in CEE devices such as tablets and smart-phones helps end-users to provide a reliable way to use their services. The worldwide connectivity of CEE devices using ICT enhances and has expanded the users? experience. However, the increasing use of ICT in CEE has led to the risk of various attack vectors and unauthorized access to consumers? personal information. The opportunity for attackers is directly proportional to the volume of information stored in CEE devices. ICT has opened up a number of privacy and security issues in CEE, such as consumer information exposure, unauthorized software updates, and insecure communication, which have become key research challenges.
The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to information security in CEE is feasible and sound. The currently available AI techniques for information security in CEE are still in the challenging phase, such as collecting and processing large amounts of data from diverse CEE devices. The design and development of AI techniques for CEE security make rapid innovations possible. It can deliver efficient AI-based solutions to handle the large amount of CEE data with limited computational capacity.

This special issue focuses on the design and development of innovative AI principles and methods for CEE security. We invite technical articles that have a broad scope and general interest to an engineering audience. The topics of interest include the following:

* Context-aware information security in CEE
* Innovative deep learning paradigms for CEE security
* Prevention of consumer information exposure using AI
* Large-scale graph paradigms for information analysis
* Extraction and analysis of CEE device data for decision support and optimization
* Trusted update mechanisms for CEE
* Reinforcement learning for large-scale data analysis
* Big data analysis using AI in the CEE industry
* AI for a secure Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem
* Adversary profiling using intelligent and automated methods
* Detection of cyber threats using AI
* Privacy and security issues in CEE Software and Hardware Systems
* Smartphone and mobile device security
