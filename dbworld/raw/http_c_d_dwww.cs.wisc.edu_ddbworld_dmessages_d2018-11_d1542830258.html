  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">?The Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing (UKP) Lab at the Department of Computer Science, Technische Universit?t (TU) Darmstadt, Germany has an opening for an

Associate Research Scientist
(PhD-level; for an initial term of two years)

to strengthen the group¡¯s profile in the areas of Interactive Text Analysis and Natural Language Processing Tools. The UKP Lab is an internationally recognized research institute with about 35 team members. We work on various aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a rapidly developing focus on Interactive Machine Learning. Besides, we provide a range of high-quality open source software packages for interactive and automatic text analysis to research and industry communities and collaborate with both academic and industrial partners.

We ask for applications from candidates in Computer Science with a specialization in Semantic Web Technologies and either Information Retrieval or Natural Language Processing, preferably with expertise in research and development projects, and strong communication skills in English and German.

The successful applicant will work on research and development for interactive text annotation by end-users (researchers, analysts, etc.). This includes neural network-based methods for knowledge graph construction and completion, interactive sequence labeling recommender systems, or semantic information retrieval. We integrate the results in a real-life collaborative text annotation software for large-scale interactive corpus analysis. 

Ideally, the candidates should have demonstrable experience in designing and implementing complex (NLP and/or ML) systems (frontend and backend), in applying NLP-related Machine Learning-based methods (e.g. learning-to-rank, clustering, etc.), experience with information retrieval systems (e.g. Lucene, Solr, ElasticSearch) and relational databases (SQL), semantic web technologies (e.g. RDF, OWL, SPARQL), and strong programming skills especially in Java. Experience with neural network architectures (e.g. knowledge-base embeddings) and demonstrable engagement in open- source projects are a strong plus.

UKP¡¯s wide cooperation network both within its own research community and with partners from research and industry provides an excellent environment for the position to be filled. The Department of Computer Science of TU Darmstadt is regularly ranked among the top ones in respective rankings of German universities. Its unique research focus "Data Science¡± and the Research Training Group ¡°Adaptive Information Processing of Heterogeneous Content¡± (AIPHES)&nbsp;funded by the DFG emphasize NLP, machine learning, text mining, as well as scalable infrastructures for the assessment and aggregation of knowledge. UKP Lab is a highly dynamic research group committed to high-quality research results, technologies of the highest industrial standards, cooperative work style and close interaction of team members working on common goals. In 2018, Darmstadt has achieved the first place in the category Cities of the Future in a ranking of German cities.

Applications should include a detailed CV, a motivation letter and an outline of previous working or research experience (if available). 

Applications from women are particularly encouraged. All other things being equal, candidates with disabilities will be given preference. Please apply under https://recruitment.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/&nbsp;by 15.12.2018. The positions are open until filled. Later applications may be considered if the position is still open.
