The MDM series of conferences, since its debut in 1999, has established itself as 

a prestigious forum for the exchange of innovative and significant research results 

in mobile data management. The conference provides unique opportunities to bring 

researchers, engineers, and practitioners together to explore new ideas, techniques, 

and tools, and exchange experiences. 



Continuing its history, MDM 2019 seeks submissions of original research contributions 

in the intersection of mobile computing and data management. Topics of interest 

include, but not limited to: 



- Mobile Cloud Computing and Data Management in the Mobile Cloud 

- Data Management for Internet of Things (IoT) and Sensor Systems 

- Data Management for Augmented Reality Systems 

- Connected Cars, Intelligent Transportation Systems, Smart Spaces 

- Mobile Crowd-Sourcing and Crowd-Sensing 

- Mobile Data Analytics 

- Behavioural/Activity Sensing and Analytics 

- Mobile Location-Based Social Networks 

- Mobile Recommendation Systems 

- Context-aware Computing for Intelligent Mobile Services 

- Middleware and Tools for Mobile and Pervasive Computing
