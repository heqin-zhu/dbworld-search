ICWS 2019 program committee invites you to participate in 2019 edition of ICWS, to be held on June 25 - June 30, 2019, San Diego, USA.

The International Conference on Web Services (ICWS) has been a prime international forum for researchers, academics, businesses, industry, and standard bodies to exchange the latest fundamental advances in the state of the art and practice of Web-based services , identify emerging research topics, and define the future of Web-based services. Internet/Web-based services are not limited to Web services. In 2019, we will strive to advance the largest international professional forum on Internet/Web-based services.

ICWS 2019 is a member of Services Conference Federation (SCF). SCF 2019 will have the following 10 collocated service-oriented sister conferences: 2019 International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2019), 2019 International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD 2019), 2019 International Conference on Services Computing (SCC 2019), 2019 International Congress on Big Data (BigData Congress 2019),2019 International Conference on AI &amp; Mobile Services (AIMS 2019), and 2019 World Congress on Services (SERVICES 2019), 2019 International Congress on Internet of Things (ICIOT 2019), 2019 International conference on Cognitive Computing (ICCC 2019), 2019 International Conference on Edge Computing (EDGE 2019), and 2019 International Conference on Blockchain (ICBC 2019).

From technology foundation perspective, Services Computing has become the default discipline in the modern services industry. As a major implementation technology for modernizing services industry, Web services are Internet-based programmable application components published using standard interface description languages and universally available via uniform communication protocols. In its 2019 version, the program of ICWS 2019 will continue to feature research papers with a wide range of topics, focusing on various aspects of Web-based services . Some of the topics include Web services specifications and enhancements, Web services discovery and integration, Web services QoS (e.g., security, performance, reliability, fault tolerance, etc.), Web services standards and formalizations, Web services modeling, Web services engineering, Web services testing, Web services-based applications and solutions, Web services realizations, semantics in Web services, Web services supporting Cloud Computing, Web services lifecycle management, and all aspects of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) infrastructure and middleware.

The technical program of ICWS 2019 will include a Research Track, an Application Track, and a Short Paper Track. The ICWS 2019 tracks seeks original, UNPUBLISHED research papers reporting substantive new work in various aspects of Internet/Web based services. Research Track papers MUST clearly indicate their contributions to the field of Web-based services. All papers MUST properly cite related work in the field, such as those published in the proceedings of ICWS, SCC, CLOUD, AIMS, BigData Congress, SERVICES, APSCC, ECOWS, and related journals including STBD, STCC, STIOT, JWSR, STSC, and IJBPIM (see Literature Recommendations page).

Review Policy

SCF Policy and professional ethics require that referees treat the contents of papers under review as privileged information not to be disclosed to others before publication. It is expected that no one with access to a paper under review will make any inappropriate use of the special knowledge, which that access provides. Contents of abstracts submitted to conference program committees should be regarded as privileged as well, and handled in the same manner. The Conference Publications Chair shall ensure that referees adhere to this practice.

Organizers of SCF conferences are expected to provide an appropriate forum for the oral presentation and discussion of all accepted papers. An author, in offering a paper for presentation at a SCF conference, or accepting an invitation to present a paper, is expected to be present at the meeting to deliver the paper. In the event that circumstances unknown at the time of submission of a paper preclude its presentation by an author, the program chair should be informed on time, and appropriate substitute arrangements should be made. In some cases it may help reduce no-shows for the Conference to require advance registration together with the submission of the final manuscript.

About the Services Society

The Services Society (S2) is a non-profit professional organization that has been created to promote worldwide research and technical collaboration in services innovations among academia and industrial professionals. Its members are volunteers from industry and academia with common interests. S2 is registered in the USA as a "501(c) organization", which means that it is an American tax-exempt nonprofit organization. S2 collaborates with other professional organizations to sponsor or co-sponsor conferences and to promote an effective services curriculum in colleges and universities. The S2 initiates and promotes a "Services University" program worldwide to bridge the gap between industrial needs and university instruction. The Services Society has formed 10 Special Interest Groups (SIGs) to support technology and domain specific professional activities.

SCF As A Platform

-- SCF 2019 Defines Future of New ABCDE (AI, Blockchain,Cloud, bigData, Everying is connected)

As the founding member of the Services Conference Federation (SCF), the first International Conference on Web Services (ICWS) was held in June 2003 in Las Vegas, USA. Meanwhile, the First International Conference on Web Services - Europe 2003 (ICWS-Europe'03) was held in Germany in Oct, 2003. ICWS-Europe'03 is an extended event of the 2003 International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2003) in Europe. In 2004, ICWS-Europe was changed to the European Conference on Web Services (ECOWS), which was held at Erfurt, Germany. SCF 2018 was held successfully in Seattle, USA. To celebrate its 17-year-old birthday, SCF 2019 will be held on June 25 - June 30, 2019, San Diego, USA. In the past 16 years, ICWS community has been expanded from Web engineering innovations to scientific research for the whole services industry.

The service delivery platforms have been expanded to mobile platforms, Internet of Things, cloud computing, and edge computing. The services ecosystem is gradually enabled, value added, and intelligence embedded through enabling technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, and cognitive computing. In the coming years, all the transactions with multiple parties involved will be transformed to blockchain.

Based on the technology trends and best practices in the field, the Services Conference Federation (SCF) will continue serving as the conference umbrella's code name for all services-related conferences. Today, we are very proud to announce that SCF 2019's 10 co-located theme topic conferences will all center around "services", while each focusing on exploring different themes (web-based services, cloud-based services, Big Data-based services, services innovation lifecycle, AI-driven ubiquitous services, blockchain driven trust service-ecosystems, industry-specific services and applications, and emerging service-oriented technologies).


SCF 2019 Highlights:

- Bigger Platform: The 10 collocated conferences (SCF 2019) get sponsorship from the Services Society which is the world-leading not-for-profits organization (501 c(3)) dedicated for serving more than 30,000 worldwide Services Computing researchers and practitioners. Bigger platform means bigger opportunities to all volunteers, authors and participants.Meanwhile, Springer provides sponsorship to best paper awards and other professional activities. All the 10 conference proceedings of SCF 2019 will be published by Springer and indexed in ISI Conference Proceedings Citation Index (included in Web of Science), Engineering Index EI (Compendex and Inspec databases), DBLP, Google Scholar, IO-Port, MathSciNet, Scopus, and ZBlMath.


- Brighter Future: SCF 2019 highlights the Second International Conference on Blockchain (ICBC 2019) to build the fundamental infrastructure for enabling secure and trusted services ecosystems. It will also lead our community members to create their own brighter future.

- Better Model: SCF 2019 will continue to leverage the invented Conference Blockchain Model (CBM) to innovate the organizing practices for all the 10 theme conferences. Senior researchers in the field are welcome to submit proposals to serve as CBM Ambassador for an individual conference to start better interactions during your leadership practices for organizing SCF 2019.


See you all on June 25 - June 30, 2019, San Diego, USA.
