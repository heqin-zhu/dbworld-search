Introduction
Computing systems are growing in capability and complexity including hardware, software, communications, networks, platforms, services, etc. Advanced computing aims to discover, develop, and deploy novel computing and networking systems. At the same time, computing must be trustworthy to engender confidence that systems will remain secure and available. Trust/distrust relationships embedded in computing systems and networks are key factors to enable dynamic interactions and cooperation of various users and services. Trusted computing aims at making these systems and services available, predictable, accountable, controllable, assessable, sustainable, dependable, persistent, and secure.
ATC conferences have taken a leading role in addressing these challenges and achieving practical advanced computing systems with truly trustworthy services. Started in 2005, the series of ATC conferences have been held at Nagasaki (Japan), Vienna (Austria), Three Gorges (China), Hong Kong (China), Oslo (Norway), Brisbane (Australia), Xi???an (China), Banff (Canada), Fukuoka (Japan), Vietri sul Mare (Italy), Bali (Indonesia), Beijing (China), Toulouse (France), San Francisco Bay Area (USA), and Guangzhou (China). IEEE ATC 2019 will offer a forum for researchers to exchange ideas and experiences in the most innovative research, development and applications related to Advanced Computing and Trusted Computing.

The 16th IEEE International Conference on Advanced and Trusted Computing (IEEE ATC-19) will be held in Leicester, UK from August 19th to 23rd, 2019. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 

- High Performance Computing and Networking
