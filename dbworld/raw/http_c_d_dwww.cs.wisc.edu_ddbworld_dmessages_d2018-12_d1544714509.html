About the Workshop

Can we build inclusive and representative machine-learning based-algorithms? Who is responsible for harm when algorithmic decision-making results in discriminatory outcomes? To whom should algorithms be transparent? What approaches to ethics might algorithms require? The FATES on the Web 2019 (Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, Ethics, and Society on the Web) is the first edition of a workshop to bring together researchers and enthusiasts concerned with the urgent challenges concerning algorithmic fairness and accountability, transparency, and ethics on data management and social interaction on the web. It will be co-located with The Web Conference 2019 (www2019.thewebconf.org/), formerly known as WWW conference, to be hosted in San Francisco, California, celebrating this year the 30th anniversary of the Web.

The workshop will promote the discussion around these critical questions and join forces towards a Web that is truly inclusive and open, a Web for Good.
