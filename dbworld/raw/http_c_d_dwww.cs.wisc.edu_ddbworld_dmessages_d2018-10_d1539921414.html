Open Source on Distributed Memory Management via RDMA for the Speed
--------------------------------------------------------------------


GAM (Globally Addressable Memory) is a distributed memory management platform which provides a global, 
unified memory space over a cluster of nodes connected via RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access). 

GAM allows nodes to employ a cache to exploit the locality in global memory accesses, and uses an RDMA-based, 
distributed cache coherency protocol to keep cached data consistent. Unlike existing distributed memory 
management systems which typically employ Release Consistency and require synchronization primitives 
to be explicitly called for data consistency, GAM enforces the PSO (Partial Store Order) memory model 
which ensures data consistency automatically and relaxes the Read-After-Write and Write-After-Write 
ordering to remove costly writes from critical program execution paths.
