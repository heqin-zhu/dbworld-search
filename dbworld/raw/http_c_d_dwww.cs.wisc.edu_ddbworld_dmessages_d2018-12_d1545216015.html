  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">A postdoc position is available in the Data-Intensive Systems group, Department of Computer Science at Aarhus University.

Successful applicants must demonstrate an ability to publish their work in top-ranked data mining, machine learning or database research outlets. Key topics of interest include time series analysis, data mining and machine learning, in particular, trend prediction and analysis, sensors and Internet of Things, temporal databases, query processing and indexing, including solutions for modern hardware (multi-core, GPGPU). 

The responsibilities include research in time series and sequence analysis, also in collaboration with industry partners in monitoring complex systems in production and infrastructure management, along with modest teaching and service tasks.

The department employs some 120 members of staff and has about 800 students. The department is strong in both theoretical and experimental research, and it is recognized internationally for its contribution within theory as well as the practice of computing. To encourage a multi-disciplinary attitude to research, no firm dividing lines are drawn between the various subjects, and there is lively interaction among subjects. 

Aarhus University has about 40,000 students. Among over 17,000 universities world-wide, it is ranked in the top 100 by several influential rankings. Aarhus is the second-largest city in Denmark and is situated by the sea in East Jutland. Aarhus is a "young" city due to its disproportionally large population of young inhabitants.

The position is initially for one year, but may be extended to two years, subject to available funding. The annual salary is approximately EUR 60,000 (inclusive of pension contributions and pre taxes).

Applicants should send a letter of interest, a CV including list of publications, copies of two relevant publications, the names of at least two references, and the preferred starting date to Professor Ira Assent (at ira@cs.au.dk). Applications will be considered as they are received and until the position is filled.
