  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The 2019 ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference, Amsterdan, The Netherlands, June 30 - July 5, 2019
                         
We solicit proposals for tutorials to be presented at the 2019 ACM SIGMOD conference. Proposals must provide an in-depth survey of the chosen topic with the option of describing particular pieces of work in detail. 
A meaningful summary of open research issues on the topic should be included. Each accepted tutorial is expected to jump-start non-experts, equipping them with the crucial knowledge required to commence research on the topic. 

Submission Guidelines

Tutorial proposals should be no more than 6 pages in the same SIGMOD format as research papers. 
They should be submitted by e-mail to the chairs (ioana.manolescu@inria.fr and hakanh@google.com). Please use "SIGMOD 2019 tutorial proposal" as the message subject.
Each submission should include the following information: 

    The proposed tutorial title.

    The preferred duration (1.5 or 3 hours). If both options are possible, the proposal should identify which material will be included for each length.

    An abstract.

    Enough detail to provide a sense of both the scope of the material to be covered and the depth to which it will be covered.

    A short description of the intended audience and any prerequisite knowledge for attendees.

    A very brief biography of the proposed presenter(s), along with contact information.

    If (part of) the tutorial material or an earlier version of it has been or will be presented elsewhere before SIGMOD 2019, the proposal should indicate those events (and dates), and describe how the current proposal differs from the previous editions.

A short description of the tutorial will be included in the conference proceedings. Tutorial slides are expected to be made available to conference participants and also uploaded as supplementary material to the ACM Digital Library (linked to the tutorial description) after the tutorial.
