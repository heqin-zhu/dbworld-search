  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Postdoctoral Fellowship Available in Data-Driven Knowledge Mobilization, Translation &amp; Innovation

Now hiring:  a postdoctoral fellow to work on an NSERC Strategic Partnership Grant fellowships (beginning as soon as possible).  The postdoctoral fellow will work under the supervision of Dr. Kelly Lyons in the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto in the iDB Lab and will also work closely with Dr. Periklis Andritsos in the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto, Dr. Kellogg Booth in the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia, Yvonne Coady in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Victoria, Dr. Ren?e Miller in the Department of Computer Science at Northeastern University, and Dr. Eleni Stroulia in the Computing Science Department at the University of Alberta. The postdoctoral fellow will also work with a number of company partners.

The goal of this research project is to develop methods and tools for analyzing and enhancing the data sets through which knowledge workers collaborate, our hypothesis being that, by doing so, we can effectively amplify their productivity. These methods and tools will be validated through case studies with several partner organizations including industry partners and Canadian research networks. We will demonstrate how our tools can enhance innovation productivity, and help mobilize the work products of our partners towards adoption and value creation.

Qualifications: Postdoctoral researchers with a background and interest in data analysis (text analysis, natural-language processing, social-network analysis), data visualization, systems design, innovation, knowledge and technology translation are encouraged to apply.  Experience with mixed-methods approaches (e.g., quantitative data analysis and qualitative survey-interview analysis) are important. Knowledge in information retrieval, machine learning and statistics will be considered a plus. 

In coming to the Faculty of Information, the postdoctoral fellow will find an intellectually diverse and rich environment, and an ideal place to pursue ground-breaking research. The postdoctoral fellow will work under the mentorship of Dr. Lyons (who has considerable project management and leadership experience, both in academia and in the industry as the IBM CAS Director from 2004-2007) and will work with students, industry partners, and participate in collaborative research with all members of the research team.  The postdoctoral fellow will gain knowledge and experience in leadership, research management, and student supervision and will have significant opportunities to interact and work with our industrial partners. 

Applicants should send a CV (that includes a link to their github profile), cover letter and the names of three references to Dr. Kelly Lyons:

This post-doctoral fellow opportunity has an annual salary of CAD$50,000 and is awarded until September 30, 2019.

Employment as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Toronto is covered by the terms of the CUPE 3902 Unit 5 Collective Agreement.

Deadline to apply: December 1, 2018.
