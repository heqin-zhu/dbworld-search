===========================================================

The Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD) is one of the longest established and leading international conferences in the areas of data mining and knowledge discovery.  It provides an international forum for researchers and industry practitioners to share their new ideas, original research results, and practical development experiences from all KDD related areas, including data mining, data warehousing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, databases, statistics, knowledge engineering, visualization, decision-making systems, and the emerging applications.

PAKDD 2019 will be held from April 14-17, 2019, in Macau, China, a city on the Pearl River estuary with a rich history where Chinese, Portuguese and other Western cultures have combined to create a unique cultural mix.


We invite proposals for half-day (3-4 hours) tutorials from active researchers in both academia and industry who are experienced and engaging presenters.


Ideally, a tutorial will cover the state-of-the-art research, development and applications in a specific data mining direction, and stimulate and facilitate future work. Tutorials on interdisciplinary directions, novel and fast growing directions, and significant applications are highly encouraged.

A tutorial proposal should include the following and should not exceed 4 pages excluding references:

- Title
- Abstract
- Presenters' name, affiliation, address, email, phone
- A biographical sketch of the presenter(s)
- Outline including a short summary of every section
- Specific goals and objectives
- Expected background of the audience
- Audio Visual equipment needed for the presentation
- A list of up to 20 most important references that will be covered in the tutorial


IMPORTANT DATES
***************
- Proposals due: November 16, 2018
- Tutorial notification: December 22, 2018
- Submission of tutorial notes: March 29, 2019

Please submit your proposals by email to the Tutorial Co-Chairs Bob Durrant (bobd@waikato.ac.nz) and Yang Yu (yuy@nju.edu.cn).


Proposals will be evaluated by the tutorial co-chairs based on merit and relevance. The tutorial presenters will be required to provide comprehensive tutorial notes (printable slides) prior to the event, which will be published on the PAKDD web site and made available to conference attendees free of charge.


Tutorials will be presented during the main PAKDD conference as parallel sessions, and all presenters named in the proposal MUST attend to present the tutorial or the session may be cancelled. For each accepted tutorial proposal the PAKDD organising committee will provide support for attendance in the form of ONE full registration to the conference.
