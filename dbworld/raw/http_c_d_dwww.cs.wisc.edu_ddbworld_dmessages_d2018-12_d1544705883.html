*** Submission Deadline: May 3rd, 2019 ***


The International Conference on Informatics in Schools: Situation, Evolution
and Perspectives (ISSEP) is a forum for researchers and practitioners in the
area of Informatics education, in both primary and secondary schools. The
conference provides an opportunity for educators and researchers to reflect
upon the goals and objectives of this subject matter, its curricula, various
teaching and learning paradigms and topics, as well as the connections to
everyday life ? including the various ways of developing Informatics
Education in schools.

The conference focuses on educational goals and objectives of Informatics
or Computer Science as a subject matter in primary, secondary and
vocational education and their different realisation in compulsory and
voluntary courses.

 
Scope

The main topics of the conference are:

? Sustainable education in Informatics for pupils of all ages
? Connecting Informatics lessons to the students? everyday lives
? Teacher education in Informatics
? Research on Informatics in schools (empirical / qualitative / quantitative /
theory building / research methods / comparative studies / transferability
of methods and results from other disciplines)
? Computer tools in teaching and studying Informatics

In particular, contributions solicited cover a variety of topics including but
not limited to:

? Accessibility
? Assessment
? Application of intelligent technologies to personalise learning
? Application of Learning Analytics to analyse learners behaviour
? Classroom management
? Communication skills
? Contests and Competitions in Informatics
? Computers and society
? Courseware
? Curriculum issues
? Diagnostic teaching
? Empirical methods
? Ethical/societal issues
? Gender and diversity issues
? High school/college transition issues
? Information systems
? Interdisciplinary courses and projects
? Laboratory/active learning
? Learner profiles
? Learning personalisation
? Misconceptions
? Multimedia
? Pedagogy
? Programming contests
? Students cognitive traits
? Students learning styles
? Student retention and persistence
? Research in Informatics education
? Role of programming and algorithmics
? Teacher education
? Using emerging instructional technologies
? Web-based techniques

Work submitted to ISSEP should be novel and material that has been
previously published should not be republished unless the work has been
significantly revised. Note however, that while novel work is highly valued,
constructive replication of previous studies can also be a significant
contribution, and a new interpretation or evaluation of previously-published
work can make a good contribution.

The submission site for ISSEP 2019 will be available soon on the conference
web site.


Call for Manuscripts
 
Authors are invited to submit high-quality manuscripts reporting original
unpublished research and recent developments in the topics related to the
conference. All papers will be peer reviewed and comments will be provided
to the authors.

There are three different submission categories:
? Research and theory papers
? Best practice papers / country reports
? Work in progress / discussion papers

Submissions must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS style
guidelines  using LaTeX. The maximum length of the paper (including
references, but excluding the optional appendix) is 12 pages. For online
Latex editors, see e.g. Overleaf and ShareLatex. Abstract length ?
200-300 words.

Submissions are reviewed using a double-blind process. Authors should
leave their names and affiliations blank in the articles submitted for review,
and take care to avoid details in the article that could be used to identify the
authors. These include institution information, specific funding information
and clear self-citations.

When using the LNCS style, do not change the margin size or the font, do
not make a separate title page, etc.: use the LNCS style file as given.
However, please do add page numbers, which can be done, for example,
by adding \pagestyle{plain} just before \begin{document}.

Accepted papers will be included in the ISSEP 2019 local proceedings.
Selected top quality papers will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes
in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Authors will also have the possibility to
extend their work and publish it in the journal ?Computer Tools in
Education Journal?.
