The 5th International Conference on Big Data Innovations and Applications (Innovate-Data 2019) 

26-28 August 2019, Istanbul, Turkey 

<a href="http://www.ficloud.org/innovate-data-2019/">http://www.ficloud.org/innovate-data-2019/</a>

(Planned for Springer: Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS))
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Big data has become a key asset in modern societies, economies, and governmental organizations. Big data encompasses various kinds of complex and large scale information that are beyond the processing capabilities of conventional software and databases. The increasing volume and velocity of the data, captured by business organizations, web repositories, social media, data centres, cloud and IoT, have resulted in the exponential growth of big data. Big data provides a key basis for innovations in various domains and applications. It can benefit data managers, developers, companies and various kinds of organizations to carry out useful analysis of data pattern and trends, make intelligent decisions, and solve complex problems that can help societies and economies and speed up innovations. The aim of the Innovate-Data conference is to promote the state of the art in scientific and practical research of big data and to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and public sector in an effort to present their research work and share research and development ideas.
