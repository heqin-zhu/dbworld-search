15 February 2019--Melbourne Australia. Co-Organized with WSDM 2019


We'd like to invite you to submit your papers for the CARS-BDA 2019 to be held in Melbourne on 15 Feb. 2019.




This workshop aims to bring together researchers with wide-ranging backgrounds to identify important research questions, to exchange ideas from different research disciplines, and, more generally, to facilitate discussion and innovation in the area of context-aware recommender systems and big data analytics. 

CARS-BDA 2019 welcomes all researchers in the database, data mining, natural language processing, information retrieval to submit their original research contributions relating to all aspects of recommendation and data analytics. In particular, topics of interest for this workshop include (but are not limited to):                
Context modeling techniques for recommender systems;
Context-aware user modeling for recommender systems
Context selection techniques for recommender systems;
Big data analytics techniques for recommender systems;
Data sets for context-dependent recommendations;
Algorithms for detecting the relevance of contextual data;
Algorithms for incorporating contextual information into recommendation process;
Algorithms for building explicit dependencies between contextual features and ratings;
Interacting with context-aware recommender systems;
Novel applications for context-aware recommender systems;
Large-scale context-aware recommender systems;
Evaluation of context-aware recommender systems;
Mobile context-aware recommender systems;
Context-aware group recommendations;
Evaluation of context-aware recommender systems.
Submissions will be reviewed by the PC members of CARS-BDA 2019. Papers will appear in the workshop proceedings, which will be publicly available online for no charge. Accepted papers will have a presentation (oral and/or poster) at the workshop.

Papers must be submitted in PDF according to the new two-column ACM format published in the ACM guidelines, selecting the generic "sigconf" sample. Papers should be no more than six pages in length, including diagrams, appendices, and references.

The research paper review process is single-blind: all author names and identifying information could appear in submissions. Research papers can be submitted for review via the online submission system. Submissions are due by November 25, 2018.

Important Dates:
Abstract Submission: 25 November, 2018
