9th Temporal Web Analytics Workshop (TempWeb 2019)
in conjunction with The Web Conference 2019
May 13/14, San Francisco, CA, USA
<a href="http://www.temporalweb.net/">http://www.temporalweb.net/</a>

As in previous years, the objective of this workshop is to provide a venue for researchers of all domains (IE/IR, Web mining, etc.) where the temporal dimension opens an entirely new range of challenges and possibilities. The workshop?s ambition is to keep shaping a community of interest on the research challenges and possibilities resulting from the introduction of the time dimension in web analysis. The maturity of the Web, the emergence of large-scale repositories of web material, makes this very timely and a growing number of research projects and services are emerging that have this focus in common. Having a dedicated workshop will help, we believe, to take a rich and cross-domain approach to this continuous research challenge with a strong focus on the temporal dimension.

TempWeb focuses on investigating infrastructures, scalable methods, and innovative software for aggregating, querying, and analyzing heterogeneous data at Internet scale. Emphasis will be given to temporal data analysis along the time dimension for web data that has been collected over extended time periods. A major challenge in this regard is the sheer size of the data it exposes and the ability to make sense of it in a useful and meaningful manner for its users. It is worth noting that this trend of using big data to make inferences is not specific to web content analytics. A now-common strategy in post-genomic biology is to measure, quantitatively, the action of all (or as many as possible) of the genes at the level of the transcriptome, proteome, metabolome and phenotype, and to use computerised methods to infer gene function via various kinds of pattern recognition techniques. On the Web, to a large extent, we have also reached this point. Web scale data analytics therefore needs to develop infrastructures and extended analytical tools to make sense of these. Workshop topics of TempWeb therefore include, but are not limited to following:

? Web scale data analytics
? Temporal Web analytics
? Distributed data analytics
? Web science
? Web dynamics
? Data quality metrics
? Web spam evolution
? Content evolution on the Web
? Systematic exploitation of Web archives
? Large scale data storage
? Large scale data processing
? Time aware Web archiving
? Data aggregation
? Web trends
? Topic mining
? Terminology evolution
? Community detection and evolution
