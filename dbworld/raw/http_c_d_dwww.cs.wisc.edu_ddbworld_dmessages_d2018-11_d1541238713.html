SPECIAL ISSUE ON ADVANCEMENTS IN KNOWLEDGE ELICITATION FOR COMPUTER-BASED CRITICAL SYSTEMS, ELSEVIER

The International Journal of Future Generation Computer Systems (FGCS) welcomes submissions to the special issue on "Advancements in Knowledge Elicitation for Computer-based Critical Systems" (https://www.journals.elsevier.com/future-generation-computer-systems/call-for-papers/knowledge-elicitation-for-computer-based-critical-systems)

#Overview
========
The increasing availability of big data has enabled the massive application of machine and deep learning techniques across the domain of computer-based critical systems. A huge set of automatic learning frameworks are now available, and are able to tackle with different kinds of systems, enabling the diffusion of Big Data analysis, cloud computing systems and (Industrial) Internet of Things. As such applications become more and more widespread, data analysis techniques have shown their capability to identify operational patterns and to predict future behaviour for anticipating possible problems.
Knowledge outcoming from these approaches are still hard to manipulate with high-level reasoning mechanisms (formal reasoning, model checking, model-based approaches) and needs novel approaches, solutions and techniques able to combine the power of both model manipulation and data analysis. 
This special issue aims at exploring the synergy of model-based and data-driven approaches in order to boost critical applications and systems analysis and monitoring. We are particularly interested in contributions that focus on model-driven approaches able to combine models and data according to different paradigms and techniques (e.g., data annotation, model learning, feature engineering). Such combination may be oriented to assessment/supervision of functional properties (e.g., correctness, absence of mis-behaviours) or quality of service (e.g., performance, dependability and cyber resilience).


#Topics
======
Topics of interests include, but not limited to:
 
- Methodologies integrating/comparing modelling and data oriented approaches
- Explicit knowledge elicitation from machine learning approaches
- Data alignment for models@runtime
- Attack and failure pattern recognition in critical system
- Model-driven reverse engineering applied to data analysis
- Process/event mining based methods and approaches
- Feature Engineering in functional and non-functional properties analysis 
- Multi-formalism modelling approaches and multi-solution analysis processes 
- Model-based machine learning
- Machine learning approaches and techniques 
- Machine learning based architecture for control systems analysis  
- Advanced architectures for (industrial) Big Data management 
- Approaches for the assessment/supervision of the system quality of service (i.e., performance, dependability and cyber resilience) that integrate data and/or models


#Paper solicitation
==============
Both theoretical papers and practical application papers are warmly welcome, especially ones focusing on real scale case studies in application domains where physical world meet cutting-edge computing systems: (Industrial) Internet of Things, Big Data analysis architectures, Distributed Computing Systems, Smart Manufacturing and Smart Industrial settings, Intelligent Transportation Systems, Smart Cities, Smart Power Grids, Active and Assisted Living, etc. Inquiries, including questions about appropriate topics, may be sent via email to the guest editors.


# Important Dates
==============
 - Paper Submission Due: February 15, 2019 CET.
 - First Round of Reviews: May 15, 2019.
 - Revised Papers Due: July 15, 2019.
 - Final Author Notification: September 15, 2019.

# Instructions for Authors
===================
Submitted contributions must contain original unpublished work not concurrently submitted or under review anywhere elsewhere. The selection of accepted papers will be based on relevance, quality and originality. 

The submission system guides you stepwise through the process of entering your article details and uploading your files. The system converts your article files to a single PDF file used in the peer-review process. Editable files (e.g., Word, LaTeX) are required to typeset your article for final publication. All correspondence, including notification of the Editor's decision and requests for revision, is sent by e-mail. 
For the special issue the submission procedure is the following:
1. Author registers in EES (<a href="http://ees.elsevier.com/fgcs">http://ees.elsevier.com/fgcs</a> follow the instruction on the site)
2. Select: Submit Manuscript from Main Menu
3. When choosing Article Type please select the title of the special issue "Advancements in Knowledge Elicitation for Computer-based Critical Systems" 

This journal operates a single blind review process. All contributions will be initially assessed by the editors for suitability for the journal. Papers deemed suitable are then typically sent to a minimum of two independent expert reviewers to assess the scientific quality of the paper. The Editors are responsible for the final decision regarding acceptance or rejection of articles. The Editors? decision is final.


# Manuscript Formatting
==================
Word processors
Papers must be in singe-column format. Keep the layout of the text as simple as possible. For word processors, please don't use options to justify text or to hyphenate words. However, do use bold face, italics, subscripts,
superscripts etc. When preparing tables, if you are using a table grid, use only one grid for each individual table and not a grid for each row. If no grid is used, use tabs, not spaces, to align columns.
Other author information can be found at www.elsevier.com/locate/fgcs

LaTeX
You are recommended to use the Elsevier article class elsarticle.cls to prepare your manuscript and
BibTeX to generate your bibliography. Elsevier LaTeX site (https://www.elsevier.com/authors/author-schemas/latex-instructions) has detailed submission instructions, templates and other information.

Failure in adhere to formatting requirements can be grounds for rejection.
