Evolving and adaptive fuzzy models for data streams

Special session at EUSFLAT2019, September 9-13, 2019 - Prague
<a href="http://eusflat2019.cz/">http://eusflat2019.cz/</a>


Scope

Nowadays a wide range of real-world scenarios yield data streams, i.e.
collections of data being generated continuously either over time or
over space. E-commerce and banking transactions, weather forecasting
recordings and sensor data, customer reports and network traffic
records are common examples of data streams produced every day.
Accordingly there is an urgent need of methods capable to handle and
analyze streams of data that are usually vast in volume (or possibly
infinite), high-dimensional and changing dynamically. Analysis of data
streams requires models that are specifically designed to adapt
continuously and automatically to smooth evolutions (drifts) and
abrupt changes (shifts) in the data distribution. Evolving intelligent
systems (EIS) is an emerging field that focuses on adaptive evolving
models in soft computing. 

The main objective of this special session is to discuss the potential
of fuzzy techniques to develop EIS for prediction and classification
tasks in challenging scenarios involving data streams.


Topics

The special session is intended to collect novel ideas and share
different experiences in the field of evolving fuzzy models for data
streams. Submission of papers covering theoretical and application
aspects of evolving fuzzy models are encouraged. Possible topics
include (but are not limited to):

- Learning in non-stationary environments
- Online/incremental fuzzy clustering
- Fuzzy techniques for data stream mining
- Evolving Fuzzy Systems
- Evolving Rule-Based Classifiers
- Evolving Neuro-Fuzzy Systems
- Adaptive Evolving Fuzzy Systems
- Online Genetic and Evolutionary Algorithms
- Adaptive Pattern Recognition
- Incremental and Evolving Fuzzy ML Classifiers
- Big Data analysis through Fuzzy techniques


Important dates

Paper submission deadline: February 1, 2019
Notification of acceptance:   April 1, 2019

Please submit your manuscript according to the general instructions
for authors for EUSFLAT 2019, <a href="http://eusflat2019.cz/submission.html">http://eusflat2019.cz/submission.html</a>

Submissions to EUSFLAT2019 can be either for a full papers, to be
included in the proceedings (indexed book), or for a 1-page abstract,
which will appear in the book of abstracts (with ISBN). Accordingly,
in the first submission step please choose either of the two tracks
"Full papers in proceedings" or "Book of Abstracts". Then in the
second step choose the special session "Evolving and adaptive fuzzy
models for data streams".
