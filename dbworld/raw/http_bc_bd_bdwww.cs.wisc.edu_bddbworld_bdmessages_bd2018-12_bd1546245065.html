Future Generation Computer Systems
Special Issue on Trusted Cloud-Edges (CE) Computations
******************************************************

Current and future service-based software needs to remain focused towards the development and deployment of large and complex intelligent and networked information systems, required for internet-based and intranet-based systems in organizations, as well to move to IoT integration and big data analytics. Today, service-based software covers a very wide range of application domains as well as technologies and research issues. This has recently found realization through the integration of cloud computing and IoT, forming a revolutionary paradigm, cloud-assisted Internet of things (CoT), that enables intelligent and self-con?guring (smart) IoT devices to be connected with the cloud through the Internet. However, huge volume of data generated from real-world applications leads to the operation difficulty of CoT paradigm. More specifically, while billions of connected devices will generate exabytes of data every day, moving all the data from comparably resource-constrained IoT devices to the cloud becomes a big challenge. 
Hence, the centralized CoT model is undergoing a paradigm shift towards a decentralized model termed as edge computing, where local and distributed edge devices such as smartphones, smart gateways, and local PC with weaker capability than the centralized cloud can offer cloud-like service for only a limited group of devices. While the centralized cloud is still inevitable for the heavyweight computation needs, in this emerging Cloud-Edges (CE) paradigm, the cloud, together with local edge devices jointly offer services and intelligence. CE paradigm complements traditional CoT paradigm in terms of high scalability, low delay, location awareness, and instant local client computing capabilities. Nonetheless, due to the multiple and even highly distributed roles in CE paradigm, vital elements in such CE paradigm are the notions of trust, security, privacy and risk management among the cloud, edge devices, and end devices.

This special issue solicits submissions from both academia and industry presenting novel research in the context of trusted Cloud-Edges (CE) computations, presenting theoretical and practical approaches to cloud, big data, IoT and edge computing trust, security, privacy and risk management. This special issue will provide a special focus on the intersection between cloud paradigm, big data analytics, IoT integration and edge computing, bringing together experts from the four communities to discuss on the vital issues of trust, security, privacy and risk management in cloud computing, shedding the light on novel issues and requirements in domains of big data, IoT, and edge computing. Potential contributions could cover new approaches, methodologies, protocols, tools, or verification and validation techniques. We also welcome review papers that analyze critically the current status of trust, security, privacy and risk management in the cloud, big data, IoT, and edge computing. Papers from practitioners who encounter trust, security, privacy, and risk management problems, and seek understanding are finally welcome. Best papers from the 7th International Symposium on Secure Virtual Infrastructures - Cloud and Trusted Computing
