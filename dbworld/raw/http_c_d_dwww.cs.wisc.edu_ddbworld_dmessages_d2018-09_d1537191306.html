Call details
============
While computing is provided by the cloud and services increasingly pervade our daily lives, dependability, adaptiveness and security become a cornerstone of the information society. Unfortunately, most innovative systems and applications (Internet of Things, Industrial IoT, Smart Environments, Mashups, NewSQL) suffer from a lack of dependability and security, which is fueled by global scale, mobility and heterogeneity, as well as the demand for resource awareness, green computing, and increasing cost pressure.

Among technical factors, software development methods, tools, and techniques contribute to dependability and security, as defects in software products and services may lead to failure and also provide typical access for malicious attacks. In addition, there is a wide variety of fault and intrusion tolerance techniques available, including persistence provided by databases, redundancy and replication, group communication, transaction monitors, reliable middleware, cloud infrastructures, light-weight virtualization (docker), fragmentation-redundancy-scattering, and trustworthy service-oriented architectures with explicit control of quality of service properties and service level agreements.

Furthermore, adaptiveness is envisaged in order to react to observed, or act upon expected changes of the system itself, the context/environment (e.g., resource variability or failure/threat scenarios) or users' needs and expectations. Provided without explicit user intervention, this is also termed autonomous behavior or self-properties, and often involves monitoring, diagnosis (analysis, interpretation), and reconfiguration (repair). In particular, adaptation is also a means to achieve dependability and security in a computing infrastructure with dynamically varying structure and properties and can itself be provided as a service (Control-as-a-service).
