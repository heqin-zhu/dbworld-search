  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Final Call for Tutorials 
EDBT/ICDT 2019 Joint Conference, Lisbon Portugal
March 26-29, 2019


We solicit proposals for tutorials for presentation at the EDBT/ICDT
2019 Joint Conference to be held in Lisbon, Portugal. Proposals must
provide an in-depth survey of the selected topic with the option of
describing specific works in depth. Proposals should include a
meaningful summary of open issues in the area. The topic of the
tutorial should be broad enough to attract a significant audience and
must include enough details to provide a sense of both the scope of
the material to be covered and the depth to which it will be covered.

**Submission Guidelines**

Tutorial proposals should be submitted by email, as a single PDF file
to the Tutorial Chair, Irini Fundulaki (fundul@ics.forth.gr). Please
use in the subject of the email the phrase ¡°EDBT/ICDT 2019 Tutorial
Submission¡±. The submission should not be more than 4 (four) pages
long, in the ACM Proceedings Format. Each submission should include
the following information:

1. Proposed Tutorial title
2. Preferred Duration (1.5 or 3 hours; if the tutorial can be of
   either length, please be sure to identify which material is
   included for each case)
3. Abstract
4. Outline presenting the scope and depth of the coverage of the
   topics to be addressed by the tutorial
5. Specific tutorial goals and objectives
6. Intended Audience and any prerequisite knowledge the audience must

   including contact information
8. If an earlier version of the tutorial has been presented in a
