                                                         Call For Research Papers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   45th  International Conference on Very Large Data Bases (VLDB 2019) 
                                                         <a href="http://vldb.org/2019">http://vldb.org/2019</a>

                                             Los Angeles, California, USA - August 26-30, 2019
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The annual VLDB conference is a premier annual international forum for database researchers, vendors, practitioners, application developers, and users. PVLDB, established in 2008, is a scholarly journal for short and timely research papers, with a journal-style review and quality assurance process. PVLDB is distinguished by a monthly submission process with rapid reviews. Its issues are published regularly throughout the year. Your paper will appear in PVLDB soon after acceptance, and possibly in advance of the VLDB conference. All papers accepted in time will be published in PVLDB Vol. 12 and also presented at the VLDB 2019 conference.

We invite submissions of original research papers to Volume 12 of the Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment (PVLDB). Papers accepted by June 15, 2019 will form the Research Track of the 2019 VLDB conference, together with any rollover papers from Volume 11. Papers accepted to Volume 12 after June 15, 2019 will be rolled over to the 2020 VLDB conference.

PVLDB is the only submission channel for research papers to appear in the VLDB 2019 conference. The submission process for other VLDB 2019 tracks is different, and is described in their respective calls for papers. In addition to traditional research papers, PVLDB welcomes thought provoking papers that fall under the following special categories within the research track:

Experiment and Analysis Papers:
These papers focus on the evaluation of existing algorithms, data structures, and systems that are of wide interest. The scientific contribution of an E&amp;A track paper lies in providing new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods rather than providing new methods.

Innovative Systems and Applications Papers:
These papers describe novel architectures for data systems, and non-obvious lessons learned in their application. The details of design goals (e.g., the class of workload to be supported), systems architecture, new abstractions, and design justifications are expected. 

Systems papers come in many flavors. They may describe the design issues and architecture of a complete system, or focus on specific issues, such as storage, query processor, indexes, transaction management of a system, or extension of an open source for certain applications not well supported, or address specific performance issues, such as algorithms designed to exploit new hardware (multi core, SIMD, NUMA, HTM, SGX, etc). 

Vision Papers:
Vision papers outline futuristic information systems and architectures or anticipate new challenges. Submissions would describe novel projects that are in an early stage but hold out the strong promise of eventual high impact.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PVLDB welcomes original research papers on a broad range of topics related to all aspects of data management.

                                                         Submission Process
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Papers are to be formatted according to the conference?s camera-ready format, as embodied in the document templates available at <a href="http://vldb.org/2019/?formatting-guidelines">http://vldb.org/2019/?formatting-guidelines</a>. 

Same as PVLDB 2018: The maximum research paper length is 12 pages, not including references whose pages could extend paper length to beyond the 12 pages limit. There is no limit on the number of pages used for references. 

The conference management tool for the submission of abstracts and papers is accessible at: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/VLDB2019/

PVLDB uses a novel review process designed to promote timely submission, review, and revision of scholarly results. The process will be carried out over 12 submission deadlines during the year preceding the VLDB 2019 conference. We describe manuscript preparation and submission procedure at <a href="http://vldb.org/2019/?submission-guidelines">http://vldb.org/2019/?submission-guidelines</a>.

* A Rolling Deadline occurs on the 1st of each month, 5:00 PM Pacific Time (Daylight Savings observed according to US calendar). This deadline is strict and no extensions will be granted.
