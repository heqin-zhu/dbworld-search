Special session on Data Mining &amp; Knowledge Discovery 
FQAS 2019 (<a href="http://www.fqas2019.units.it/">http://www.fqas2019.units.it/</a>)  
July 3-5, Amantea, Italy

Supported by Horizon 2020 - the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020) - under grant agreement n? 786687 (the COPKIT project)

Data Mining aims at the automatic discovery of underlying non-trivial knowledge from datasets by applying intelligent analysis techniques. The interest in this research area has experienced a considerable growth in the last years due to two key factors: (a) knowledge hidden in organizations? datasets can be exploited to improve decision-making; and (b) the large volume of managed data makes it impossible to apply traditional techniques, moving forward new paradigms such as Big Data.

These issues are also becoming frequent in data and knowledge acquisition within the smart cities, societies and social networks. Big data, Data mining and knowledge discovery methods can be used to extract from heterogeneous sources elaborated knowledge that can be afterwards fused with sensor-based data and other information. Furthermore, data mining and knowledge discovery methods can be applied on fused data to achieve better inferences towards situation and threat assessment. 

Consequently, the scientific community can benefit from well-established approaches and new advances in data mining and knowledge discovery ?such as machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms, imprecise and uncertain knowledge management formalisms, big data analysis tools, natural language processing techniques, etc.? to develop systems able to exploit information sources more efficiently. This includes soft data not generated by conventional sensors; e.g. text, links and human perceptions retrieved from social networks. 

The session is open to contributions generated by specialists in related areas in order to promote interdisciplinary collaborations and cross-fertilization.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following
?	Data, text and web mining
?	Stream data mining
?	Temporal data series
?	Big data mining
?	Data mining for security
?	Data pre- and post- processing in data mining
?	Imprecision, uncertainty and vagueness in data mining
?	Parallel and distributed data mining algorithms
?	Deep learning in data mining
?	Information summarization and visualization
?	Human-machine interaction for data access
?	Semantic models to represent input data and extracted knowledge in a Data Mining process
?	Applications of Data Mining techniques: anomaly detection, cyber-security, emergency management, situation recognition, health, tourism, biological process, customer profiles, etc.
