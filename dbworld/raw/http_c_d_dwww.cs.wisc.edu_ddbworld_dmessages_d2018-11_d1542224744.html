Registration Policy
--------------------------
The extended abstract will appear in the ICDE 2019 proceedings under a special track for TKDE papers, and the authors must present the work at the ICDE poster session. Regarding the policy of ICDE registrations, the authors of an extended abstract (TKDE posters) will be treated in the same way as the authors of an ICDE paper. At least one of the authors must register for the conference before the camera-ready deadline, and this registration can be cancelled only after registration of another author. The registration is based on attendance; that is, if an author is going to ICDE 2019 to present multiple posters or papers accepted for ICDE, we only charge the author once for ICDE registration.
