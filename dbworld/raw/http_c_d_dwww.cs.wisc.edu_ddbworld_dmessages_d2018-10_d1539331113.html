Big Data Privacy

The massive deployment of networking, communications and computing technologies has brought us into the era of big data. Huge volumes of data are today generated and collected due to human-computer interation, device-device communications, data outsourcing, environment sensing and behavior monitoring. Many such data often encode privacy-sensitive information related to individuals and support the inference of a large variety of privacy-sensitive information through the use of data analytics, data mining and machine learning. Thus, preserving privacy in the context of big data is a critical requirement in cyber-space. Obviously, preserving privacy of big data is even more challenging when dealing with many emerging technologies, e.g., Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, edge computing, crowdsourcing and crowdsensing, social networking, and next generation communication systems. Although technologies and theories are widely studied and applied to ensure data privacy in recent years, existing solutions are still inefficient, especially for big data. Preserving privacy of big data introduces additional challenges with regard to computational complexity, efficiency, adaptability, personality, flexibility, fine-graininess and scalability. Big data privacy promises many novel solutions and at the same time, many challenges should also be overcome.

This special issue aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss various aspects of big data privacy, explore key theories, investigate significant algorithms, protocols and schemes and innovate new solutions for overcoming major challenges in this significant research area.

Topics include but are not limited to:
?	Theoretical aspects of big data privacy
?	Privacy-preserving computing models and techniques
?	Fine-grained and personalized privacy preservation 
?	Privacy auditing and provenance management on big data
?	Adaptive privacy preservation on big data
?	Scalability of big data privacy protection
?	Big data privacy protection based on blockchain
?	Secure big data computation and verification
?	Privacy preserving big data search and query
?	Privacy preservation in big data fusion
?	Privacy-preserving machine learning and data mining
?	Privacy digitalization and computation 
?	Economic studies on big data privacy
