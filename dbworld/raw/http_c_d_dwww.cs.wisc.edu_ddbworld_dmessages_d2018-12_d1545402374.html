  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Systems Analysis division, DTU Management Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, invites applications for a 3-year PhD position related to the digital platform for next-generation district heating system design, operation, and planning. The position will be part of the new research project HEAT 4.0 led by the Danish engineering consulting company, NIRAS A/S, and funded by Innovation Fund Denmark.

District heating is a key contributor to achieving a sustainable energy sector in the countries that adopt this solution, mainly Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands. Today district heating operators are facing many challenges, largely due to the lack of integrated solutions. The HEAT 4.0 project will fill this gap by developing a comprehensive and flexible integrated digital platform that can enable district heating companies to meet the demands of customers and society in an adaptive and cost-efficient way. The platform will first be targeted at the domestic market and finally the international market. The project results will improve environmental gains by increasing the share of renewable energy sources and utilization of waste heat sources for heating purposes.

Responsibilities and tasks. 

The aim of the PhD project is to identify the limitations of current district heating systems, and to work with other project partners to develop a next-generation district heating planning platform. The tasks involve developing communication protocols between different software components, application programming interfaces, cloud-based services, and data management platform. The PhD student will also carry out the research on model and algorithm development using optimization (across different modelling tools) and data-intelligence approaches, including data mining, machine learning, and deep learning.

As a PhD student, you will be employed at DTU Management Engineering and closely collaborate with industry partners and other researchers in the HEAT 4.0 project. A research stay of 3-6 months in an international research institute is planned as part of the PhD study.

Your responsibilities and tasks associated with the position include:
Undertake your PhD study developing models, algorithms, and methods for smart energy
Be part of the HEAT 4.0 project team working on the software development
Active participation in the research environments at DTU
Presentations of your work at project meetings and at international conferences and workshops
Publish research results in peer-reviewed scientific journals and conference proceedings 
QualificationsCandidates should have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree.

The ideal candidate will meet the following requirements:
A master's degree in computer science or engineering graduated within 3 years
Strong programming skill, especially experience in using Python and R
