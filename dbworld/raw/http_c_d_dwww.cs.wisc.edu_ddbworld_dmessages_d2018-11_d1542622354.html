AIMS AND SCOPE
--------------

CAiSE'19 invites proposals for tutorials on advanced topics in the field of Information Systems engineering. These tutorials will be 90 minutes long and should aim at offering new insights, knowledge, and skills to managers, teachers, researchers, and students seeking to gain a better understanding either about methods of broad interest in the field, or emergent paradigms that are ripe for practical adoption or that require further research to reach maturity. Proposals emphasizing the special theme of the CAISE'19 conference ''Responsible Information Systems'' are highly encouraged, but proposals on other new or long-standing fundamental challenges of Information Systems Engineering are also welcome.

Tutorials are intended to provide a pedagogic introduction to or overview of a topic of relevance. Potential presenters should keep in mind that there may be quite a varied audience, including novice graduate students, seasoned practitioners, and specialized researchers. Tutorial speakers should be prepared to cope with this diversity in the audience. Tutorials will be organized in parallel with the technical sessions of the main conference and participants of the conference will have free access to all of them. Tutorials should be focused on principles, concepts and methods. Commercial or sales-oriented presentations are discouraged.

Tutorial proposals should be sent by email to caise2019tutorial@lists.ut.ee. Potential proposers are free to contact the tutorial chairs using this email address to validate their idea prior to the submission. The tutorial chairs will review each proposal and select a subset of them based on the following criteria: (1) relevance to the field of IS engineering; (2) anticipated appeal to the conference audience; (3) timeliness and importance vis-a-vis of the conference audience; (4) past experience and qualifications of the instructor(s). The tutorial chairs will also consider the complementarity of the proposal w.r.t. the conference program and other tutorial proposals.
