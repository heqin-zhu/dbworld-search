The 27th Euromicro International Conference on Parallel, and
Network-Based Computing
Pavia, Italy
13-15 February 2019

AIMS AND SCOPE
The development of models through which computers can simulate the evolution of artificial and natural systems is fundamental for the advancement of Science. In the last decades, the increasing power of computers has allowed to considerably extend the application of computing methodologies in research and industry, but also to the quantitative study of complex phenomena. This has permitted a broad application of numerical methods for differential equation systems (e.g., FEM, FDM, etc.) on one hand, and the application of alternative computational paradigms, such as Cellular Automata, Genetic Algorithms, Neural networks, Swarm Intelligence, etc., on the other. These latter have demonstrated their effectiveness for modelling purposes when traditional simulation methodologies have proven to be impracticable.

Following the success of our past HPCMS workshops we are glad to invite you to our sixth edition which will take place in Pavia (Italy). 

An important mission of the HPCMS Workshop is to provide a platform for a multidisciplinary community composed of scholars, researchers, developers, educators, practitioners and experts from world leading Universities, Institutions, Agencies and Companies in Computational Science, and thus in the High Performance Computing for Modelling and Simulation field.
HPCMS intent is to offer an opportunity to express and confront views on trends, challenges, and state-of-the art in diverse application fields, such as engineering, physics, chemistry, biology, geology, medicine, ecology, sociology, traffic control, economy, etc.


Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
- High-performance computing in computational science: intra-disciplinary and multi-disciplinary research applications
- Complex systems modelling and simulation
- Cellular Automata, Genetic Algorithms, Neural networks, Swarm Intelligence implementations
- Integrated approach to optimization and simulation
- MPI, OpenMP, GPGPU applications in Computational Science
- Optimization algorithms, modelling techniques related to optimization in Computational Science
- High-performance Software developed to solve science (e.g., biological, physical, and social), engineering, medicine, and humanities problems
- Hardware approaches of high performance computing in modeling and simulation

IMPORTANT DATES
Paper submission: 30 October 2018 
Acceptance notification: 20 November 2018 
Camera ready due: 19 December 2018 
Conference: 13 - 15 February 2019

Submission guidelines
Prospective authors should submit a full paper not exceeding 8 pages in the IEEE Conference proceedings format (IEEEtran, double-column, 10pt). Double-bind review: the first page of the paper should contain only the title and abstract; in the reference list, references to the authors own work should appear as "omitted for blind review" entries. For submission, please use the following link and select the HPCMS session: <a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pdp2019">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pdp2019</a>

Manuscript submission Publication
All accepted papers will be included in the same volume, published by the Conference Publishing Services (CPS). The Final Paper Preparation and Submission Instructions will be published after the notification of acceptance. Authors of accepted papers are expected to register and present their papers at the Conference. Conference proceedings will be submitted for inclusion in Xplore and the CSDL, and for indexing, among others, to DBLP, Scopus ScienceDirect, and ISI Web of Knowledge. 

Special Issue
As for previous editions, organizers of the HPCMS session are planning a Special Issue of an important international ISI Journal, based on distinguished papers that will be accepted for the session.
