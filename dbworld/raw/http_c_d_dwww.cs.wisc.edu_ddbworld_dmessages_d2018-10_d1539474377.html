This is an immediate openning on a joint project between Lawrence
Berkeley National Lab and UC Berkeley.  The following is a brief
outline:

  Machine learning has transformed the time-consuming task of developing
  custom analysis tools into a feasible computational task.  As the
  operator of some of the largest high-performance computing facilities,
  DOE could significantly improve these machine learning tools and
  accelerate scientific discoveries.  One of the key challenges in this
  process is the interpretability of the results from the automated
  learning process.  For example, deep neural networks are known to be
  effective in extracting signals, but their results are notoriously
  hard to understand.  In this work, we plan to extend key ideas from
  statistical mechanics to improve understanding and guide the design of
  well-known machine learning algorithms.  The new approaches will not
  only produce more interpretable results but also dramatically increase
  the convergence rate of the associated learning algorithms.
  Furthermore, the new approach is inherently more parallelizable, and
  therefore could take advantage of the large high-performance computers
  available at DOE facilities.  We anticipate to produce a set of highly
  parallel learning tools based on the new insights gained from
  statistical mechanics and randomized algorithms.  The design of these
  tools will be guided by the requirements of the on-going and upcoming
  large data producers around the lab including distributed acoustic
  sensing from earth science and water resource monitoring from energy
  technology applications.
