SMDB 2019
10th International Workshop on Self-Managing Database Systems
https://db.cs.pitt.edu/smdb2019
April 12, 2019
In conjunction with IEEE ICDE 2019
Macau SR, China

===================================================================================

WORKSHOP INFORMATION

Autonomic, or self-managing, systems are a promising approach to
achieve the goal of systems to be easier to use, simpler to maintain,
and more robust in their operating characteristics. A system is
considered to be autonomic if it is self-configuring, self-optimizing,
self-healing, and/or self-protecting. The aim of the SMDB workshop is
to provide a forum for researchers from both industry and academia to
present and discuss ideas and experiences related to self-management
and self-organization in all areas of Information Management in
general. SMDB targets not only classical databases, but also the new
generation of storage engines and in-memory databases. Beyond
databases, SMDB aims to cover autonomic aspects of data-intensive
systems represented by large-scale map-reduce and cloud environments,
where much work on self-management is needed. Last, but not least,
SMDB seeks to expand its horizons to include self-management of
non-traditional, new areas such as social networks, distributed
gaming, and peer-to-peer systems.

The series of SMDB workshops have always been held in conjunction with
IEEE ICDE. Early workshops of the SMDB series focused on core topics
in self-managing databases such as automated tuning and provisioning,
automated problem diagnosis and recovery, and automated data
protection and integration. Since 2010 the scope of the workshop has
been broadened to include new topics in the core database area, such
as multi-tenant databases and data management in cloud computing, but
also drawing in other communities, such as, peer-to-peer computing and
distributed systems. For the SMDB 2019 workshop, we want to continue
to attract researchers from both the core database and other
communities, such as the adaptive, data stream and event-based systems
communities as enabling technologies for self-managing systems, and
data-intensive internet-scale distributed systems that utilize the
recent advances in AI, machine learning and data mining and analysis.

TOPICS OF INTEREST
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Principles and architecture of autonomic data management systems
Retro-fitting existing systems vs. designing for self management
Self-* capabilities in databases and storage systems
Data management in cloud and multi-tenant databases
Autonomic capabilities in database-as-a-service platforms
Automated testing of data management systems
Automated physical database design and adaptive query tuning
Automated provisioning and integration
Automatic enforcement of information quality
Robust query processing techniques
Self-managing data stream engines and adaptive event-based systems
Self-managing distributed / decentralized / peer-to-peer information systems
Self-management of internet-scale distributed systems
Self-management for big data infrastructures
Monitoring and diagnostics in data management systems
Policy automation and visualization for datacenter administration
User acceptance and trust of autonomic capabilities
Evaluation criteria and benchmarks for self-managing systems
Self-evaluation of data management services in the cloud
Use cases and war stories on deploying autonomic capabilities

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
Authors are invited to submit original research contributions in
English of up to 6 pages in the IEEE camera-ready format (templates
