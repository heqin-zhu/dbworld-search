** Call for Workshop/Special Session Proposals ** 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In conjunction with MUE2019, we will organize some workshops.
The workshop proposals should be submitted to Prof. Yunsick Sung (yunsicksung@gmail.com).

Several workshops will be held in conjunction with MUE2018 with the aim to explore special topics and provide international forums for scientists, engineers, and computer users to exchange and share their experiences, new ideas, and research results on hot topics on new multimedia solutions and ubiquitous computing.
Workshops for presenting papers from industrial companies and papers on implementations of systems and services are very welcome.

One workshop MUST have at least 8 registered papers.
Otherwise, the papers will be moved to the another workshop.

All accepted papers will be published by Springer as Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering (LNEE) Pre/Post-Proceedings (indexed by EI and SCOPUS).
High quality papers will be recommended special issue of SCI(E) Journal. 
- It will be decided by Workshop organizers.

In general, a workshop takes one day, although multiple-days and half-day workshops are welcome.
