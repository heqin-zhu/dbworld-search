  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">IEEE Transactions on Services Computing Special Issue on Blockchain-Based Services Computing

Blockchain has become a hot research area in academia and industry. A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records of value transfer transactions maintained by a peer-to-peer network through a distributed consensus mechanism. Blockchain technology has promising characteristics regarding decentralization, persistency, anonymity and auditability that could greatly improve the cost-effectiveness of inter-organization business processes. Blockchain can be applied to many fields of services computing, e.g., big data, cloud
computing, digital economy, intelligent contracts, Internet-of-Things, security, etc. Non-functional innovations in blockchain-based services computing is essential to improving the efficacy of blockchain. This special issue focuses on presenting novel approaches to integrating blockchain and services computing techniques as well as factual insights on what new challenges and requirements exist in doing so.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
 Blockchain-as-a-Service and blockchain services DevOps
 Blockchain based industrial application services
 Smart contract and distributed ledger for blockchain-based services
 Theories and algorithms for blockchain-based services
 Security, privacy and trust for blockchain-based services
 Scalability and fault tolerance mechanisms for blockchain-based services
 Design, optimization, and learning-based analysis of blockchain-based services
 Edge/cloud intelligence for blockchain-based services
