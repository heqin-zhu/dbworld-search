  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Second international conference on data science and social research
The Data Science and Social Research international conference encourages contributions about:
new methodological developments to extract social knowledge from large scale data sets;
new social research about human behaviour and society with large datasets, either mined from various sources (e.g. social media, communication systems) or created via controlled experiments; 
integrated systems to take advantage of new social data sources; 
big data quality issues, both as reformulation of traditional representativeness and validity and as emerging quality aspects such as access constraints, which may produce inequalities.
