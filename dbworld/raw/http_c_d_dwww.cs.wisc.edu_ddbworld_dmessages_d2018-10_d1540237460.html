  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Georgia State University
Tenure Track Position
CyberSecurity - Trans Cultural Violence and Extremism (Next Generation Faculty Program)
GSU Position: 20-042

As part of its Next Generation Program ( <a href="http://secondcentury.gsu.edu/next-generation-program/">http://secondcentury.gsu.edu/next-generation-program/</a>) and pending budgetary approval, Georgia State University anticipates hiring a tenure-track hire at the assistant/associate rank in cyber security to begin Fall 2019, pending budgetary approval. Ph.D. required. Recognizing that non-state and state sponsored actors now seek to destroy, incapacitate, or exploit infrastructures to threaten national security, we are seeking a faculty member with an active research program in the means and methodologies of how such groups expand their power and influence through attacks in and through the online environment. The targeted hire should bring expertise in discerning patterns in malevolent hacker behavior, identifying sources of online propaganda, and/or detecting and developing profiles for insider threat. Competitive candidates should ideally be able to demonstrate evidence of effort in attracting grant, contract or other extramural funding.

The hire will join an interdisciplinary team of Georgia State scholars working on Transcultural Conflict and Violent Extremism (TCVE), with their home department negotiable. TCVE brings together scholars from Anthropology, Communication Studies, Computer Science, Global Studies, Political Science, Psychology, and Religious Studies, and a dozen, competitively selected, Presidential Ph.D. Fellows to better understand the causes and solutions regarding conflict and violent extremism happening around the globe. Our team has received support for its research program from DOJ, DHS, the British Foreign Council, NSF, NIJ, and the Department of Defense, among others.

To apply, candidates should send a letter of interest, curriculum vita, and three letters of reference to Carol Winkler, Chair of the Cyber Security Search Committee, Department of Communication, P.O. Box 5060, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA 30302-5060. Materials sent to cwinkler@gsu.edu will also be accepted. Candidate review will begin November 15, 2018 and remain open until position is filled. Georgia State University, a Title III and Title V institution located in downtown Atlanta, GA, is an Equal Opportunity Employer and does not discriminate against applicants due to race, ethnicity, gender, veteran status, or on the basis of disability or any other federal, state or local protected class.
