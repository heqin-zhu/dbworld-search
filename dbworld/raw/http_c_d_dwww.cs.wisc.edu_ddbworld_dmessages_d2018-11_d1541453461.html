Science at Binghamton University (The State University of New York at Binghamton) invites 
applications for one tenure-track assistant professor position in the areas of Data 
Science/Data Analytics/Core Machine Learning beginning in Fall 2019.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. in Computer Science or a closely related discipline by the

building a diverse and inclusive teaching, research, and working environment. We are 
particularly interested in candidates with a commitment to diversity and inclusiveness. 
Historically underrepresented minorities, women, persons with disabilities, and veterans, 
are strongly encouraged to apply.

Binghamton University, nationally recognized for its academic excellence, is one of the 
four Ph.D. granting University Centers within the SUNY system. The Computer Science 
Department has well established Ph.D. and M.S. programs and an accredited B.S. program. 
The Department has been on a successful and aggressive growth plan in recent years. The 
Department currently has 34 faculty members, over 500 CS majors, over 300 MS students 
and over 70 PhD students. The newly-established NSF industry-university collaborative 
research center on energy-smart electronic systems and local high-tech companies such as 
IBM, Lockheed-Martin and BAE provide opportunities for collaboration. The university just 
launched a new Data Science Transdisciplinary Area of Excellent (TAE), which will provide 
opportunities for collaboration across the entire campus. The Department is also part of 
a newly approved MS in Data Analytics degree program, together with several academic units 
on campus. The Computer Science faculty excels in research within the computer systems area 
and has a significant record of success, with 3 NSF CAREER awardees in its current faculty 
and significant annual research funding from a variety of agencies. Additional information 
about the Department, its faculty and research can be found on our website.

Binghamton University has built a reputation as a world-class institution that combines a 
broadly interdisciplinary, international education with one of the most vibrant research 
programs in the nation. Binghamton is proud to be ranked among the elite public universities 
in the nation, challenging our students academically, not financially. The result is a 
unique, best-of-both-worlds college experience. Located in Binghamton, NY, we are ideally 
situated in the high-tech heart of the state. Industry partnerships, class projects and 
internship opportunities provide a wealth of hands-on experience for graduate and 
undergraduate students alike. Binghamton borders the scenic Finger Lakes region of New York.
