AIMS AND SCOPE
A founding pillar of the IoT concept is the availability of low-cost low-power devices with wireless technologies providing both sensing and actuation. In the past decade, the research community have produced proven solutions to build low-power mesh networks. Traditionally, the focus has been on short-range radio communication (e.g., ZigBee, Bluetooth, ZWave). An appealing alternative that have gained momentum in the IoT landscape, is to equip the nodes with long-range radio modules. As a result, long-range radio communication technologies (e.g., SigFox, LoRa, and 802.15.4g) are considered as candidate technologies for many low-power wide area network (LPWAN) applications, especially those that require extended coverage such as citywide sensing, environmental monitoring, or remote infrastructure monitoring.

The 1st on Emerging Technologies and Trends in Engineering Low-Power Networks (NewNets) brings together researchers and practitioners working in the field of IoT from both academia and industry, to discuss and explore short- and long-range solutions, the tradeoffs between these two paradigms, as well as how they can be used in synergy. In order to push the state of the art, several points need to be addressed: new features for the long-range technologies (i.e., over-the-air updates, roaming), radio resource management, regulations and policies on spectrum usage and sharing, business case analysis that are more well suited for certain vertical markets. 

We invite researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to submit short papers. We particularly encourage submissions that focus on one of the following:
 - protocol design;
 - hardware platform design;
 - modelling and analysis of low-power short or/and long-range communication;
 - reliability, adaptability, and dependability of short and long-range communication solutions;
 - new features for the long-range technologies (i.e., over-the-air updates, roaming);
 - radio resource management;
 - deployment experiences, case studies, and lessons learned;
 - evaluation and testbeds;
 - regulations and policies on spectrum usage and sharing;
 - business case analysis that are more well suited for certain vertical markets.


SUBMISSION AND FORMATTING
Submitted papers must contain between 4 and 6 single spaced U.S. letter pages, including all figures, tables, and references. All submissions must be written in English.

Submissions should be formatted using the standard IEEE template for Microsoft Word or LaTeX. Authors should indicate their names and affiliations on the first page of the paper. All submissions must be in PDF format and render without error using standard viewers (e.g., Acrobat Reader). Submitted papers must differ significantly in content from previously published papers and must not be currently under review for any other publication.

Paper submission deadline: Thursday, January 17, 2019 (11:59:59PM EST)
Notification to authors: Sunday, February 17, 2019	
Camera-ready submission deadline: Wednesday, February 27, 2019
