The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Adelphi University is hiring four new tenure track assistant professors.

As a result of a successful launch of new M.S. programs in Computer Science and in Statistics and Applied Mathematics, and due to the continued growth of our undergraduate CS and IS programs, Adelphi University is hiring FOUR tenure track assistant professors:

1 position for candidates in Computer Science
2 positions for candidates in Applied Mathematics/Statistics/Computer Science
1 position for candidates in Mathematics

For the CS position, we would love to attract a recent PhD who has an interest in either cybersecurity or digital forensics.

The ideal candidate would be able to teach one graduate class per semester and two undergraduate classes per semester. New candidates generally start with research release and will teach only 6 credits in their first semester with us.

Adelphi University is located on Long Island, just outside New York City.
