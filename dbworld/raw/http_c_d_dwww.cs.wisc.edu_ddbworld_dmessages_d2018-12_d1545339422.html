CALL for PAPERS

ICTERI is an annual peer-reviewed international Computer Science conference focusing on research advances and business/academic applications of Information and Communication Technologies, design, development, and deployment of advanced information systems and ICT Infrastructures. The emphasis is put on real world applications of ICT-based solutions. Therefore, all contributions are strongly encouraged to demonstrate how and to what purpose the proposed solutions are used or transferred into use. Examples of such contributions are a proof-of-concept implementation; prototype in an advanced stage; case study involving new tools and/or methodological approaches; experimental studies with real use cases, including knowledge or technology transfer; visionary papers or surveys revealing new needs and trends. Reports on academic-industrial partnerships for ICT innovation and knowledge transfer are as welcome as technological and methodological submissions.

SUBMISSION TYPES

Several types of papers are solicited for the main ICTERI conference tracks as presented below. Submission types are:

I Full (regular) research papers
- Report on accomplished, unpublished research work
- Present a novel method, technique or analysis with appropriate empirical or other evaluation as a proof of validity
- Evaluation focuses on originality, technical soundness and the soundness of the real use demonstration.
- Page limit: 16 LNCS pages.

II Short research papers
- Short reports of preliminary results or work in progress
- Evaluation focuses on originality, technical correctness and the value of the planned results in a short to mid-term perspective
- Page limit: 8 (short paper) or 4 (extended abstract) LNCS pages

III Discussion, survey, or problem analysis papers
- Help understand a relevant problem without introducing a novel method, technique or approach.
- Examples: a review placing a problem onto the state-of-the-art landscape and analyzing how far current solutions fall short; an in-depth discussion and analysis of a certain problem, with clear definitions and argumentation in terms of qualitative or quantitative representation of the main characteristics of the problem.
- Evaluation focuses on the soundness of the problem analysis and on the interest for the scientific community.
- Page limit: 16 LNCS pages.

IV Industry and Education experience reports
- Report on industrial or academic deployments of ICT
- Experiences in the effective and efficient use of ICT in education
- Evaluation focuses on significance and practical relevance, technical soundness, and accompanying evaluation or industrial validation.
- Page limit: 12 LNCS pages.

The papers submitted as one of the above types (I-IV) and (i) evaluated as not sufficiently mature by the Program Committee; and (ii) recognized by the reviewers as interesting and promising in their idea or approach; may be recommended to be considered as a Poster.

V Posters
- Concise presentations of early-stage research in the form of an Extended Abstract. These papers outline preliminary ideas, concepts, initial results shaping out the future work. Posters will be presented in a separate poster session.
- Evaluation focuses on originality, technical correctness, the value of the research ideas, and the potential to become a mature research outcome in a short-to-mid-term perspective.
- Page limit: 4 LNCS pages.
