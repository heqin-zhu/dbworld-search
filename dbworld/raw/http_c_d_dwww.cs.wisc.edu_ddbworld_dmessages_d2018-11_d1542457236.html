-------------------------

2nd International Workshop on Big Mobility Data Analytics (BMDA)
co-located with EDBT/ICDT Conference, March 26, 2019 (Lisbon, Portugal)
<a href="http://www.datastories.org/bmda19/">http://www.datastories.org/bmda19/</a>

*Submissions due December 15, 2018 (11:59pm PDT)*


Workshop Description
====================

&gt;From spatial to spatio-temporal and, then, to mobility data. The next step is mobility-aware integrated Big Data analytics. The second Big Mobility Data Analytics (BMDA) workshop, co-located with 2019 joint EDBT/ICDT Conference, aims at bringing together experts in the field from academia, industry and research labs to discuss the lessons they have learned over the years, to demonstrate what they have achieved so far, and to plan for the future of "mobility".

The objective of the BMDA workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in scalable data-intensive applications that manage and analyze big mobility data. The workshop will foster the exchange of new ideas on multidisciplinary real-world problems, discussion on proposals about innovative solutions, and identify emerging opportunities for further research in the area of big mobility data analytics, covering all layers of the Big Data Value Analytics (BDVA) reference model, namely data management, data processing, data analytics, and data visualization and user interaction. The workshop intends to bridge the gap between researchers and big data stakeholders, including experts from critical domains, such as urban / maritime / aviation transportation, human complex networks, etc.

We encourage submissions of papers that highlight the value of mobility data processing, analyzing, and mining on topics that include (but are not limited to) the following:
- Fundamentals of mobility data analytics
- Big data platforms for mobility data analytics
- Parallel / streaming data processing for mobility analytics
- Predictive analytics using mobility data
- Complex event detection for moving objects
- Visual analytics on big mobility data
- Mobility-as-a-Service
- Interactive traffic analysis with GPS data
- Urban / maritime / aviation traffic flow forecasting
- Urban / maritime / aviation travel time prediction
- Integration / interlinking of mobility with societal data
- Geosocial networks
- Philosophical / ethical / privacy issues on mobility data analytics


Paper Submission Procedure, Workshop Proceedings, Journal special section
=========================================================================

We invite papers discussing novel research and ideas without substantial overlap with papers that have been published or submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings. Submitted papers can be of two types:
- Regular Research Papers: these papers should report original research results or significant case studies. They should be 5000-8000 words (at most 8 pages) long.
- Position Papers: these papers should report novel research directions or identify challenging problems. They should be at most 4 pages long.

Submissions should be formatted using the EDBT/ICDT 2019 camera-ready template and submitted through the workshop's submission system at EasyChair [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bmda19]. Following the tradition of recent EDBT/ICDT workshops, all workshop papers will be published online at CEUR [<a href="http://ceur-ws.org/">http://ceur-ws.org/</a>]. All submitted papers will be peer reviewed by at least three reviewers. If accepted, at least one of the authors must attend the workshop to present the work.

Selected accepted papers will be considered for a special section at a relevant journal (details to be announced).
