*** Precision Digital Medicine and Health

Advances in artificial intelligence tools and methods provide better insights, reduce waste and wait time, and increase speed, service efficiencies, level of accuracy, and productivity in health care and medicine [1]. Also, the recent revolution in digital devices (e.g. mobile apps, fitness trackers, sensors, IoT assets) and their software applications enables clinicians and health care workers, consumers and patients to make better informed decisions [2]. Moreover, new initiatives such as precision health and medicine emphasize the importance of focusing on individuals? risk factors for disease prevention, early diagnosis, and intervention [3].

This special issue of the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine journal seeks original contributions presenting significant results on theory, methods, systems, and applications of data mining, machine learning, databases, network theory, natural language processing, knowledge representation, artificial intelligence, semantic web, and big data analytics, focused on applications in precision health and digital medicine. The topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following areas:

    Knowledge Representation and Extraction
    Integrated Health Information Systems
    Patient Education
    Patient-Focused Workflows
    Shared Decision Making
    Geographical Mapping and Visual Analytics for Health Data
    Social epidemiology
    Social Media Analytics
    Epidemic Intelligence
    Predictive Modeling and Decision Support
    Semantic Web and Web Services
    Biomedical Ontologies, Terminologies, and Standards
    Bayesian Networks and Reasoning under Uncertainty
    Temporal and Spatial Representation and Reasoning
    Case-based Reasoning in Healthcare
    Crowdsourcing and Collective Intelligence
    Risk Assessment, Trust, Ethics, Privacy, and Security
    Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining
    Computational Behavioral/Cognitive Modeling
    Health Intervention Design, Modeling and Evaluation
    Online Health Education and E-learning
    Mobile Health
    Internet of Things (IoT) in Health and Medicine
    Applications in Epidemiology and Surveillance (e.g. Bioterrorism, Participatory Surveillance, Syndromic Surveillance, Population Screening)
