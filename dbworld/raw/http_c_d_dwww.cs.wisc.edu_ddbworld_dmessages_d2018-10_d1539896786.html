Job description

The candidate will be a member of the Information Systems and Software Engineering research group in IDI, Trondheim and will work with the "+CityxChange" project. A brief description of the project is provided below:

Trondheim, Limerick, Alba Iulia, Pisek, Sestao, Smolyan and Voru and their industry and research partners are joining forces to co-create the future we want to live in. They have detailed out their ambitions into the +CityxChange project, which focuses on a structured approach on how to develop and deploy Positive Energy Blocks and Districts and scale these out as a part of the Clean Energy Transition. The approach combines Integrated Planning and Design, a Common Energy Market and a +CommunityxChange stakeholder engagement in the city. New forms of integrated spatial, social, political, economic, regulatory, legal, and technological innovations will deliver citizen observatories, innovation playgrounds, regulatory sandboxes, and Bold City Visions to engage all stakeholders to scale up from Positive Energy Blocks (e.g. a few connected buildings) to Positive Energy Cities, supported by a distributed and modular ICT Ecosystem Architecture and Data Integration approach. The project aims to realize Europe-wide deployment of Positive Energy Districts by 2050 and prepare the way for fully Positive Energy Cities. The ICT Ecosystem Architecture will support this through orchestration and support of distributed services and data, recommendations on the use of big data and citizen engagement, and Enterprise Architecture approaches.

The candidate will work with the following tasks within this project:

    Development of a scalable ICT Ecosystem Architecture and Roadmap for a Smart City
