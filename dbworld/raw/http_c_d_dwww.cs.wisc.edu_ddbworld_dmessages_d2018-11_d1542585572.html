Deadline extended on paper submissions: Dec 1st.

Deadline extended on data challenge: Dec 14th.

 




Tasks (i.e., defined pieces of work, ranging in scope from specific (e.g., sending an email) to broad (e.g., planning a wedding)) are central to all aspects of information access and use. Task intelligence spans technologies and experiences to extract, understand, and support the completion of short- and long-term tasks. Helping people complete tasks is a key capability of search systems, digital assistants, and productivity applications. Extracting tasks from data is a core challenge in data mining and knowledge representation and draws on additional research from areas such as ubiquitous computing, machine learning and natural language processing. Attributes of tasks, such as priority, duration, and progress toward completion, can also be inferred from data and have value in productivity applications and beyond.





The workshop will comprise a mixture of research paper presentations, a data challenge, panels and/or keynotes, and workshop-wide discussions on task intelligence. We seek submission of papers describing early stage research on all aspects of task intelligence. Specific topics of interest include, but are not limited to:





?Task extraction:
?Mining tasks from data

?Task understanding, including:
?Task attributes (duration, priority, etc.)
?Task context (leverage contextual signals to understand tasks)
?Task taxonomies and dependencies, including task ownership

?Task support, including:
?Intelligent notifications (supporting task focus)
?Intelligent interfaces (novel interfaces for task support)
?Guided task support (help me do my task)
?Contextual recommendations (assist me now)
?Task-focused search (find information related to my task)
?Scheduling (make time for my tasks)

?Task progress, including:
?User tracking for tasks
?Inferring task completion
?Summarizing completed tasks

?Task support evaluation:
?Gauging user satisfaction and utility from task support systems
