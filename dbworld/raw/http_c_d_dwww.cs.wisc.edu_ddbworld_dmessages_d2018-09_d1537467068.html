Los Angeles, CA, USA 
March 17-20, 2019

ACM IUI 2019 is the 24rd annual meeting of the intelligent interfaces community and serves as a premier international forum for reporting outstanding research and development on intelligent user interfaces.

ACM IUI is where the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community meets the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community, with contributions from related fields such as psychology, behavioral science, cognitive science, computer graphics, design, the arts, and more. Our focus is to improve the interaction between humans and machines, by leveraging both HCI approaches and state-of-the art AI techniques from machine learning, natural language processing, data mining, knowledge representation and reasoning. ACM IUI welcomes contribution from all relevant arenas: academia, industry, government, and non-profit organizations. Along with 25 other topics in AI &amp; HCI, this year we especially encourage submissions on explainable intelligent user interfaces for IUI 2019.


** Why you should submit to ACM IUI **

At ACM IUI, we focus on the interaction between machine intelligence and human intelligence. While other conferences focus on one side or the other, we address the complex interaction between the two. We welcome research that explores how to make the interaction between computers and people smarter, which may leverage solutions from data mining, knowledge representation, novel interaction paradigms, and emerging technologies. We strongly encourage submissions that simultaneously discuss research from both HCI and AI. We also welcome works that focus more on one side or the other.  

The conference brings together people from academia, industry, government and non-profit organizations and gives its participants the opportunity to present and see cutting-edge IUI work in a focused and interactive setting. It is large enough to be diverse and lively, but small enough to allow for extensive interaction among attendees and easy attendance to the events that the conference offers, ranging from oral paper presentations, poster sessions, workshops, panels and doctoral consortium for graduate students.

IUI topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Affective and aesthetic interfaces
- Big data and analytics
- Collaborative interfaces
- Education and learning-related technologies
- Evaluations of intelligent user interfaces
- Explainable intelligent user interfaces
- Explainable artificial intelligence
- Interactive visual analytics and interpretation for deep learning 
- Health and intelligent health technologies 
- Information retrieval and search
- Intelligent assistants for complex tasks
- Intelligent wearable and mobile interfaces 
- Intelligent ubiquitous user interfaces
- Intelligent visualization tools
- Interactive machine learning
- Knowledge-based approaches to user interface design and generation
- Modeling and prediction of user behavior
- Multi-modal interfaces (speech, gestures, eye gaze, face, physiological information etc.)
- Natural language and speech processing
- Persuasive and assistive technologies in IUI
- Planning and plan recognition for IUI
- Proactive and agent-based user interaction
- Recommender systems
- Smart environments and tangible computing
- Social media analysis
- User Modelling for Intelligent Interfaces 
- User-Adaptive interaction and personalization

** Dates **

Oct 8, 2018: Papers deadline	
Dec 7, 2018: Notification 		
Dec 21, 2018: Camera ready due

** Submission - Full and Short Papers **

We invite original paper submissions that describe novel user interfaces, applications, interactive and intelligent technologies, empirical studies, or design techniques. We do not require evaluations with users, but we do expect papers to include an appropriate evaluation for their stated contributions.

Accepted papers will appear in the ACM Digital Library and citation indices. A selected set of accepted top quality full papers will be invited to submit their extended versions for publication in an ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS, <a href="http://tiis.acm.org">http://tiis.acm.org</a>) special issue titled "Highlights of IUI 2019".

** Submission Guidelines ** 

- Full paper (anonymized 10 pages, references do not count toward the page limit) should make substantial, novel, and relevant contribution to the field.

- Short paper (anonymized 4 pages, references do not count toward the page limit) is a much more focused and succinct contribution to the field. Short papers are not expected to include a discussion of related work that is as broad and complete as that of Full papers.

- Anonymization: ACM IUI uses a double-blind review process. All submissions must be appropriately anonymized according to the following guidelines:
-- Author's names and affiliations are not visible anywhere in the paper.
-- Acknowledgements should be anonymized or removed during the review process.
-- Self-citations should be included where necessary, but must use the third person. For example, "... as shown in our previous user study [2] ... " is not allowed, whereas "... as shown in Smith et al. [2] " is acceptable (because in this case the citation [2] will NOT be perceived as self-citation).

- Failure to follow these guidelines may result in submissions being rejected without review.

- Authors should also be aware of the SIGCHI Policy for Submission and Review at SIGCHI Conferences, see: https://sigchi.org/about/sigchi-policies/conference-policies/submission-and-review/ 

- Submissions should follow the standard SigCHI format. Use either the Microsoft Word template (https://github.com/sigchi/Document-Formats/blob/master/Word/SIGCHIProceedingsFormat.docx) or the LaTeX template ( https://github.com/sigchi/Document-Formats/tree/master/LaTeX).

Accepted full papers will be invited for oral presentation. Accepted short papers will be invited either as oral or poster presentation.

** AUTHORS TAKE NOTE ** 

The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)
