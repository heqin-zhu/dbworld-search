About IWBigDataCity 2019

  The first international workshop on big data, cloud, and IoT
  technologies for smart cities is a forum for researchers in academia
  and industry who are interested in big data, cloud, and IoT
  technologies for smart cities and their use cases.  The goal of this
  workshop is to share novel ideas, research progress, and smart city
  use cases, and to discuss future directions of smart city
  technologies. The workshop focuses on the added value
  interconnection among state-of-the-art technologies such as, Big
  Data, cloud/edge computing, Internet of Things, blockchains, and
  others having as aim to provide services in the context of the smart
  cities. 

Topics of Interest

  The topics of this workshop cover big data, cloud, and IoT
  technologies for smart cities.  The world is facing numerous problems
  such as global warming, economic crisis, security threats, inequality,
  natural disasters, and ageing society, and ICT solutions, such as big
  data, cloud computing, and IoT, are expected as the keys to cope with
  those problems.  Meanwhile, smart cities have been emerging as an
  improved form of cities where different types of ICT solutions are
  used to efficiently manage assets and resources.  The workshop invites
  papers sharing results of smart city applications and experimentations
  performed in lab and at city scale, in particular with involvement of
  a multitude of related stakeholders. Technical validation, as well as
  assessment results of non-technical aspects such as usage, social
  acceptance, privacy or ethics related issues are particularly
  encouraged. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

  - Smart City applications 
  - Internet of Things in cities
  - Middleware technologies
  - Security and privacy
  - Cloud Computing integration
  - Communication protocols 
  - 5G deployments and applications 
  - Testbeds, deployments and experiments
  - Open data and measurement
  - Machine Learning and data mining 
  - Big Data applications
  - City context analysis, visualization, and applications
  - Blockchains and smart contracts 
  - Citizen health and lifestyle enhancement
  - Safety and disaster management
  - Location prediction in social media and web
  - Evaluation of frameworks, metrics and algorithms

  Prospective authors are invited to submit high-quality manuscripts
  presenting original work, on-going projects, and case study results in
  the abovementioned topics (but not limited to them).
