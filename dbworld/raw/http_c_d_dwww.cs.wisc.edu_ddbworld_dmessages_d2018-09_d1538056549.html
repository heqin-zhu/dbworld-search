  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">11th International Conference on Semantic Web Applications and Tools for Health Care and Life Sciences, 
3-6th December 2018, Antwerp, Belgium
<a href="http://www.swat4hcls.org/">http://www.swat4hcls.org/</a>

For over a decade SWAT4HCLS international conference has provided an open and vibrant scientific environment bringing together researchers, developers, and users, from many fields to discuss new target, current limitations and real experiences in the use of semantic and web technologies in health care and the life sciences. The 2018 event will follow a similar format as in previous years and welcomes exciting new topics into the program in a series of thematic sessions.

Topics

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to Semantic Web technologies designed for, and applied, in Healthcare and the Life Sciences.
? Knowledge representation in life sciences, medicine and healthcare and agriculture.
? Semantic approaches to data repurposing in healthcare and patient generated data
? Biomedical ontologies, rules and medical standards for information exchange and interoperability.
? Clinical Intelligence from Electronic Health Records (EHRs), patient data and clinical trial data
? Use of semantics to enable translational medicine, personalized medicine and precision agriculture.
? Application and impact of data standards applied in clinical practice, public health and agribusiness
? Semantic scientific publishing in the life sciences, medicine and healthcare, public health
? Open Data Integration and Interoperability.
? NLP and text mining using semantic technologies.
? Methods and standards to improve discoverability and reusability of data repositories
? Deep learning and semantic technologies.
? Semantic Querying, Data validation languages, Knowledge Graphs, Rule-based systems.
? Semantic workflow technologies and semantic web services applied in life sciences.
? Infrastructures supporting provenance, traceability, trust and reproducibility.
? Empirical studies and evaluation of Semantic Web tools and applications in the life science domains.
? Ethical issues, privacy and data governance in healthcare, agri, and medical data in Semantic Web.
? Future directions for Semantic Web technologies in the life sciences and interdisciplinary fields. including water science, agro science, and veterinary science, drug repositioning.
? Studies focussing on the adoption of Semantic Technologies by knowledge workers in life sciences.
? Harnessing linked data for Research Assessment/Monitoring and Evaluation
? Novel approaches to utilizing existing biomedical data without sharing it, e.g. bring the analysis to the data
In addition, we invite submissions for inclusion in thematic sessions on Open Data, Agri-Semantis, Public Health Surveillance and Secondary Use of Healthcare Data.
