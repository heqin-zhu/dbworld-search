Introduction
The proliferation of new technologies such as Internet of Things and cloud computing calls for innovative ideas to retrieve, filter, and integrate data from a large number of diverse data sources. Big Data is an emerging paradigm applied to datasets whose volume/velocity/variability is beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to manage and process the data within a tolerable period of time. More importantly, Big Data has to be of high value, and should be protected in an efficient way. Since Big Data involves a huge amount of data that is of high-dimensionality and inter-linkage, existing trust, security, and privacy measures for traditional databases and infrastructures cannot satisfy its requirements. Novel technologies for protecting Big Data are attracting researchers and practitioners with more and more attention.
 
Scope and Interests
TrustData2019 is a part of SpaCCS 2019 (<a href="http://cse.stfx.ca/~cybermatics/2019/spaccs/">http://cse.stfx.ca/~cybermatics/2019/spaccs/</a>),  12th International Conference on Security, Privacy and Anonymity in Computation, Communication and Storage. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
