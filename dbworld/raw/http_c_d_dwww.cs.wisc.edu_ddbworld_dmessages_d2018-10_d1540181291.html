THEME: The past ten years have witnessed the rapid developments and applications of cloud computing, which has evolved as a cost-effective, easy-to-use, elastic and scalable computing paradigm to transform today¡¯s business models. Recent technological trends such as Industry 4.0 and China-2050 have also introduced new challenges that cannot be solved using current cloud architectures. Such ambitions demand the connection of thousands, if not millions, of sensors and actuators coupled with optimized operations to automate various operations inside factories, cities or even countries. This led to a new era where lightweight devices are envisaged to send vital information to computing platforms for further processing and decision making. Despite being large-scaled and powerful, current cloud computing architectures are however not able to efficiently digest and process collected information from such vast number of devices/actuators, especially for those with strict requirements such as communication delay or processing deadlines. To address these issues, the new computing paradigm, called Edge Computing, is proposed and rapidly attracted great attention from both academia and industries to push the frontier of computing away from centralized nodes to the logical extremes of a network so that analytics and knowledge extractions can be performed at the source of the data. This book aims to focus on the Edge Computing paradigm due to its unique characteristics where heterogenous devices, depending on their computational capabilities, can be equipped with decision making processes and automation procedures to carry out applications (mostly) across widely geographically distributed areas.The book is sectioned into three parts (Models, Technologies and Applications) to reflect complementary view points and shed light onto various aspect of Edge Computing platforms. (1) The first part (Models) serves as an introductory section to differentiate Edge Computing from its fairly close/similar paradigms such as FC, MEC and MCC. It then highlights various theoretical models through which EC systems could be mathematically expressed and its relevant technological problems could be systematically solved/optimized.  (2) The second part (Technologies) focuses on different technologies (virtualization, networking, orchestration, etc.) where EC systems could be realized. (3) The third part (Applications) focuses on various application domains (e.g., Smart Cities) where EC systems could, or already did, help in providing novel services beyond the reach of pure/typical cloud computing solutions. The book is expected to have a total number of 500 printed pages (based on approximately 550 words per page with a 20% allowance for figures and tables), and at least 18 invited chapters (20-25 pages each).
