Tenure Track Faculty Positions - Research Stream
The Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia is inviting applications for up to 4 positions at the rank of Assistant Professor.  We invite applications from all areas of computer science, with one of the primary areas of focus being in computer systems, broadly construed.  One position at a higher rank could be considered for an individual with exceptional qualifications.

UBC Computer Science (www.cs.ubc.ca) ranks among the top departments in North America, with a strong record of excellence in research and in graduate and undergraduate teaching. The anticipated start date is July 1, 2019, and is subject to budgetary approval.

A PhD in Computer Science or a related area is required. Applicants must demonstrate evidence of research success and a high potential to be leaders in their research field. Successful candidates will develop and maintain an internationally-recognized research program, and are expected to effectively supervise graduate students, collaborate with other faculty members, obtain external funding, teach computer science courses for undergraduate and graduate students, and actively participate in departmental activities. The potential of an applicant's research program to complement and extend the existing research and teaching strengths of the department will be an important factor in selection.

Applicants must submit a CV, a research statement, a teaching statement, and the names of at least three references. The teaching statement should include a record of teaching interests and experience. Applications may be submitted online at https://apps.cs.ubc.ca/fac-recruit/research/apply/form.jsp.  Full consideration will be given to submissions received by November 30, 2018.  Applications past the deadline may continue to be considered as long as the submission website remains open.

Equity and diversity are essential to academic excellence. An open and diverse community fosters the inclusion of voices that have been underrepresented or discouraged. We encourage applications from members of groups that have been marginalized on any grounds enumerated under the BC Human Rights Code including sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, racialization, disability, political belief, religion, marital or family status, age, and/or status as a First Nation, Metis, Inuit or Indigenous person. All qualified candidates are encouraged to apply; however, Canadians and permanent residents will be given priority.

Tenure Track Faculty Positions - Educational Leadership
The University of British Columbia invites applications for one or two tenure-track faculty teaching positions at the rank of Instructor in the Department of Computer Science on the Vancouver Campus.  Preference may be given to candidates whose technical and teaching strengths show strong fit with current structural needs in our department, including the systems and software areas of computing.  However, strong candidates specializing in any area are encouraged to apply.   UBC Computer Science (https://www.cs.ubc.ca)  ranks  among the  top departments in North America, with 57 tenure-track  faculty and approximately 200 graduate and 2000 undergraduate students.

This position provides the rare opportunity to participate as a first-class colleague in the intellectually exciting atmosphere of a top-tier computer science department, while pursuing a career based on excellence in teaching and educational leadership (as explained on the Teaching and Educational Leadership page of the UBC Center for Teaching, Learning and Technology https://ctlt.ubc.ca/programs/all-our-programs/teaching-and-educational-leadership/).  Instructor is the first rank in a UBC's Educational Leadership Stream career path, which continues with the Senior Instructor rank, and culminates with the Professor of Teaching rank.   This path is analogous to the research-oriented faculty progression of tenure-track Assistant Professor, tenured Associate Professor, and Full Professor.  Initial appointment will be at the Instructor rank.   The typical teaching load is two courses per term, for a total of four courses each year.   Faculty members in the Educational Leadership stream are eligible to apply for Study Leave (sabbatical) under similar terms to faculty members in the research-oriented stream. The anticipated start date for this position is July 1st, 2019.

A PhD or equivalent in Computer Science, Computer Science Education, or a related area is expected. The successful candidate must provide evidence of: demonstrated excellence in and commitment to undergraduate teaching, ability to work collaboratively as well as independently and to supervise the work of others, promise of educational leadership at the national or international level, and potential for creating innovative instructional environments in both the undergraduate classroom and laboratory.  Experience in curriculum development, course design, and other initiatives that advance the University??s ability to excel in its teaching and learning mandate is also an asset.

Candidates should submit a CV, a teaching statement, evidence of teaching effectiveness, and the   names of   at   least   three references. The statement should include their teaching philosophy, and a record of teaching interests and experience. Candidates are encouraged to highlight qualifications relevant to emerging technologies, pedagogical approaches, and research in teaching and learning.    Applications are to be submitted online at https://apps.cs.ubc.ca/fac-recruit/instr/apply/form.jsp.

The website will remain open for submissions through the end of the day on November 15th, 2018. The website may remain open past that date at the discretion of the recruiting committee.  All applications submitted while the website remains open will be considered.

Equity and diversity are essential to academic excellence. An open and diverse community fosters the inclusion of voices that have been underrepresented or discouraged. We encourage applications from members of groups that have been marginalized on any grounds enumerated under the B.C. Human Rights Code, including sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, racialization, disability, political belief, religion, marital or family status, age, and/or status as a First Nation, Metis, Inuit, or Indigenous person.   Canadians and permanent residents of Canada who successfully meet the criteria for excellence through the application and interview process will be given priority.
