ACM UMAP - User Modelling, Adaptation and Personalization is the premier
international conference for researchers and practitioners working on
systems that adapt to individual users, to groups of users, and that collect,
represent, and model user information. 

Theory, Opinion and Reflection (TOR) are position papers that critically look
at ongoing and emerging research topics, reflections on persistent or
fleeting trends in the field and blue sky future ideas for UMAP research.
They offer an opportunity for discussing thought-provoking work relevant
to the UMAP community, albeit they are not yet ready to be published as a
full length research papers at a refereed conference. They should be of
sufficient quality and relevance to the UMAP community and demonstrate
the ability to spur discussion and debate on the future course of the UMAP
research.

The presentations will be in the form of a 10 minute pitch in a plenary
conference session, just before a break. The presenters will present the topic
and raise relevant questions to stimulate discussion during the breaks.

Submissions should have a maximum length of 4 pages in the ACM SIG proceedings template.
