Artificial Intelligence (AI) is concerned with computing technologies that allow machines to see, hear, talk, think, learn, and solve problems. The huge potential of applying AI for problem solving represents an exciting future that business objectives can be achieved much more effectively. In addition, business-business, business-customer, and customer-customer may be interconnected in a revolutionary way to stimulate tremendous amount of interesting activities. A core of AI is Knowledge Engineering that addresses the acquistion, understanding, description, storage, integration, processing, control, and use of knowledge, among others.

The 2nd IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Engineering (AIKE 2019), is an international forum for academia and industries to exchange visions and ideas in the state of the art and practice of Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Engineering, as well as to identify the emerging topics and define the future of Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Engineering.
