======================

Dear colleagues,

The Computer Science department of Ecole Polytechnique considers
hiring full-time and part-time Assistant Professors and Professors in
2019.

Teaching will take place in the Bachelor program, in the Ing¨¦nieur
Polytechnicien Program or in Master programs proposed by Ecole
Polytechnique.

For the full-time positions, the research activity will be carried out
at one of the research groups of LIX https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr,
the Computer Science Laboratory of Ecole Polytechnique. The applicants
are expected to have international scientific recognition, and
demonstrate excellent teaching skills. Mastery of the French language
is a plus, but is not essential.

We strongly encourage candidates to make contact with the research
groups at LIX before a potential interview with the selection
committee.

Precise positions will be advertised later at
(in French) <a href="http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Eric.Goubault/Postes2019.htm">http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Eric.Goubault/Postes2019.htm</a>

where you will also find an outline of the curricula in Computer
Science at Ecole Polytechnique, as well as statutes and salaries for
professors at Ecole Polytechnique.
