New Topics: Post-Cloud Computing/CDEF: Cloudlet, Dew Computing, Edge Computing, Fog Computing

========= Call for Papers ========

** About OJCC
The Open Journal of Cloud Computing (OJCC), an open access, peer-reviewed online journal, publishes original and creative research results on Cloud Computing and Post-Cloud Computing. OJCC distributes its articles under the open access model. All articles of OJCC are fully open access and online available to readers free of charge. OJCC aims to provide a forum for sharing and exchanging ideas, experiences and research results among scientists and practitioners of (Post-)Cloud technologies. OJCC publishes regular research papers, short communications, reviews and visionary papers in all aspects of Cloud Computing and Post-Cloud Computing. There is no restriction on the length of the papers. Accepted manuscripts are published online immediately.

** Scope
In cloud scenarios, computing and storage resources are typically hidden from the user. Dependant on the demand of the resources of a user's application, different amount of resources can be used from a large pool of resources, which is shared among many users. Scalable applications are required, which can deal with the different amount of resources. The business model of cloud computing is often pay-per-use: You pay what you are using.

On the other hand, the current cloud scenarios are not always suitable to different types of applications. The new computing models are emerging in the past few years. These models can be summarized as CDEF, where C represents Cloudlet, D represents Dew Computing, E represents Edge Computing, and F represents Fog Computing. CDEF starts with C also implies that these four models all started from Cloud Computing. All CDEF can be classified as post-cloud computing models.

This journal expects original and high quality papers in all the aspects of Cloud Computing and Post-Cloud Computing.
