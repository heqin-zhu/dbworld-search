The position is anchored within the Computer Science and Communications Research Unit (CSC).

? Ref: F1-50011608 (to be mentioned in all correspondence)
? Full-time position (40 hrs/week)
? Earliest starting date: Jan 2020
? Fixed-term contract: 5 years, upon a positive evaluation, perspective of a permanent position may be foreseen.

To diversify the existing skills and expertise within CSC, the candidate is expected to:
? collaborate across the various research units within the FSTC (such as Mathematics, Physics and Materials Science, Engineering, Computational and Life Sciences), with other faculties, or with the adjunct research centers (LCSB, C2DH, SnT, LIST).
? foster and take a leading role in driving research in the area of Machine Learning at the University of Luxembourg, and
? offer focused Machine Learning courses at both Bachelor and Master level.

The initial package includes a PhD and a Postdoc position. The Luxembourgish research funding agency FNR offers a broad range of further funding opportunities through projects and special excellence programs (ATTRACT/PEARL).

The FSTC is seeking to hire an outstanding and visionary candidate in the area of Machine Learning. Applicants should have an excellent international track record, a strong background in the theoretical foundations of Machine Learning, an interest in innovative Machine Learning techniques, and be open for interdisciplinary collaborations with both academia and industry. Non-exclusive possible areas of interest are Bayesian and statistical-relational learning, learning probabilistic and causal graphical models, learning other types of structured/logical knowledge, explainable learning, deep learning, unsupervised learning, big data applications (scalability, distributed and parallel execution of learning techniques), applications for natural-language processing, autonomous systems, space research, industry 4.0.

The University of Luxembourg is set in a multilingual context. The person hired on this position must be proficient in English and in one of the two official languages of Luxembourg: French or German. The University encourages its staff to learn the other official language and provides access to language courses to this end.

The University of Luxembourg:
The University of Luxembourg, which currently ranks 12th among the worldwide best universities under 50 years on the Times Higher Education (THE) list, is a public university with a strong focus on research and a very international faculty. With far more than 300 researchers, it is a major and ambitious player in Computer Science, laying the foundations for futuristic computational systems and supporting the digitization of science and society in the 21st century. The Computer Science and Communications Research Unit (csc.uni.lu), one of the main pillars of research excellence at UL, performs fundamental and applied research in intelligent, secure, communicative, and advanced software systems. It promotes interdisciplinary research and closely cooperates with other high-profile research centers in Luxembourg and beyond, as well as with industry and society, including the newly established Luxembourg Space Agency. The CSC entertains various successful and growing teaching programs and supports lifelong learning activities. It will strongly profit from Luxembourg's involvement in the EU High Performance Computing initiative.

Living in Luxembourg:
Luxembourg is a cosmopolitan country, the green heart of Europe combining the convenience of a metropolis with a human touch (www.euraxess.lu).
