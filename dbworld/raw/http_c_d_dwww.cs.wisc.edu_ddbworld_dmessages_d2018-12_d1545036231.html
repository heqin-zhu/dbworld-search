  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Data Science Department of EURECOM invites applications for a tenured position at the Assistant Professor level in the area of Machine Learning.

EURECOM hosts a well-established academic research group in the field of Data Science in Europe, as demonstrated, for example, by the recent appointment of an AXA Research Fund Chair in Computational Statistics, and by awards such as the ¡°H2020 European Stars Prize¡± for our research in Large-scale Distributed Systems and Big Data.
The activity of the professors in the department cover key areas, such as: computational statistics, theory and practice of machine learning and deep learning, adversarial learning and data economics, parallel and distributed algorithms and systems, natural language processing and information extraction, knowledge base development and semantic web technologies. Additional information on the Data Science Department is available at <a href="http://www.eurecom.fr/ds/">http://www.eurecom.fr/ds/</a>

The new faculty is expected to join forces with the department by integrating, complementing and extending existing research activities with original approaches in one or several of the following areas:
* Probabilistic Machine Learning and Computational Statistics
* Probabilistic Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning
* Statistical Learning Theory

The new faculty is expected to carry out fundamental research and to develop new graduate courses in the aforementioned domains.

While actively leading research with her/his team, the new faculty is also expected to enhance the resources of the department by attracting additional funding. Besides excellence in academic research, she/he must tackle real life machine learning problems raised by industrial applications, for example provided by EURECOM industrial partners.

NOTE: the working language at EURECOM is English, courses are delivered in English, and all communications with the administration are in English and French

Candidates must have a Ph.D. in computer science, statistics, engineering, mathematics or related disciplines, and have postdoctoral research experience in one or several of the above areas, as well as a strong publication record (e.g., NIPS, ICML, AISTATS, UAI, JMLR, IEEE-TPAMI).

Applications should include:
* a motivation letter
* a CV including a publication list emphasizing the three most important publications
* a statement of proposed research and teaching activities
* the names and addresses of four references 

Applications should be submitted by e-mail to: recruitment-mdc-ds@eurecom.fr 
with the reference: DS_PM_PROF_ML_092018

EURECOM is a French graduate school and a research center in digital sciences based in the international science park of Sophia Antipolis, which brings together renowned universities such as T¨¦l¨¦com ParisTech, Aalto University (Helsinki), Politecnico di Torino, Technische Universit?t M¨¹nchen (TUM), Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Chalmers University (Sweden) and Czech Technical University in Prague (CTU). The Principality of Monaco is a new institutional member. The Institut Mines-T¨¦l¨¦com is EURECOM¡¯s founding member.
EURECOM benefits from a strong interaction with the industry through its specific administrative structure: Economic Interest Group (kind of consortium), which brings together international companies such as: Orange, BMW Group Research &amp; Technology, Symantec, Monaco Telecom, SAP, IABG.
EURECOM deploys its expertise around three major fields: Digital Security, Data Science and Communication Systems. EURECOM is particularly active in research in its areas of excellence while also training a large number of doctoral candidates. Its contractual research is recognized across Europe and contributes largely to its budget.
Thanks to its strong ties set up with the industry, EURECOM was awarded the ¡°Institut Carnot¡± label jointly with the Institut Telecom right from 2006. The Carnot Label was designed to develop and professionalize cooperative research. It encourages the realization of research projects in public research centers that work together with socioeconomic actors, especially companies.
