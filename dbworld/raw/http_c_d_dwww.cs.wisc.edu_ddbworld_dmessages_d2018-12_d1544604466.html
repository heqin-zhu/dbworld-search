General:

Data management, knowledge discovery as well as knowledge processing are core 
and hot topics in computer science. They are widely accepted as enabling 
technologies for modern enterprises enhancing their performance, especially
in the decision making process. Since the 1990s the Internet has been the 
outstanding driving force for application development in all domains.

An increase in the demand of resource sharing (e.g. computing resources, 
services, metadata, data sources) across different sites connected through 
networks leads to an evolvement of data and knowledge management systems from 
centralized systems to decentralized systems enabling large scale distributed 
applications providing high scalability. Current decentralized systems still 
focus on data and knowledge as their main resource characterized by:

- Heterogeneity of nodes, data and knowledge
- Autonomy of data and knowledge sources and services
- Large scale data volumes, high numbers of data sources, users, computing 
  resources
- Dynamics of nodes.

Considering these characteristics recognize:

(a) limitations of methods and techniques developed for centralized systems
(b) requirements to extend or design new approaches and methods enhancing 
    efficiency, dynamics and scalability
(c) development of large scale, experimental platforms and relevant benchmarks
    to evaluate and validate scaling

Feasibility of these systems relies basically on P2P (peer-to-peer) techniques 
and agent systems supporting with scaling and decentralized control. Synergy 
between Grids, P2P systems and agent technologies is the key to data and 
knowledge centered systems in large scale environments.

The objective of the international journal on Large Scale Data and Knowledge 
Centered Systems is to provide an opportunity to disseminate original research 
contributions and a high quality communication platform for researchers and 
practitioners. The journal contains sound peer reviewed papers (research, state 
of the art and technical) of high quality.
