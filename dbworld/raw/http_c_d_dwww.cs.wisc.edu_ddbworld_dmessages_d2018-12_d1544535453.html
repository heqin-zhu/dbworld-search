Call for Papers: IEEE 32th IEEE CBMS International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (<a href="http://cbms2019.org/">http://cbms2019.org/</a>)

The 32th IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (IEEE CBMS2019) will be held at Instituto Maim?nides de Investigaci?n Biom?dica de C?rdoba, C?rdoba, Spain, from Wednesday 5th to Friday 7th of June 2019. Attracting a worldwide audience, CBMS is the premier conference for computer-based medical systems, and one of the main conferences within the fields of medical informatics and biomedical informatics. CBMS allows the exchange of ideas and technologies between academic and industrial scientists. The scientific program of IEEE CBMS 2019 will consist of regular and special track sessions with technical contributions reviewed and selected by an international programme committee, as well as, keynote talks and tutorials given by leading experts in their fields. The CBMS 2019 edition also aims to host high-quality papers about industry and real case applications as well as allow to researchers leading international projects to show to the scientific community the main aims, goals and results of their projects.
