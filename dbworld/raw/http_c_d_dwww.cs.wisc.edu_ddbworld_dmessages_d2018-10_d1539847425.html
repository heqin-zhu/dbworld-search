Summary 
The aim of this project is to develop a series of new algorithms, either offering a data masking mechanism that can keep the raw characteristics for analysis within the masked data, or a redesigned analytical approach to generate same insights from the masked data. In particular, this project needs to resolve at least the most common statistical analysis of masked security data and ideally, provide a solution to the latest machine/deep learning algorithms. In the meantime, the proposed solution has to be considered from engineering?s perspective, such as dealing with streaming data and integration into popular cloud computing environments (e.g., AWS, Azure, and GCP). 
The successful applicant will be required to part-timely work in an industrial environment and publish research outcomes in prestigious international conferences and journals in cybersecurity and data engineering, under the guidance of senior and associate supervisors.  

Applicants must: 
? meet the eligibility requirement 

? be able to commence at 2018 

? pass the police check 

? have a strong interest in one or more of the following areas: cryptography, data analytics, and cloud computing 

? be excellent at Python, Java, C/C++, and R/MATLAB
