  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">?Postdoc Position in Distributed Systems and Networks at INESC-ID (Lisbon)

==========
Position
==========

You will be working on a three-year project funded by the National Science Foundation (FCT)
The goal of the project is to address the reproducibility problems in the experimental 
evaluation of distributed systems and networks.
Experiment reproducibility is a core tenet of the scientific method but unfortunately the 
increasing complexity of the systems we build, deploy and evaluate makes it difficult to 
reproduce - and understand - experimental results.

The focus of this position is to research, design and develop the methods, models
and tools that enable: i) a better experimental evaluation process and ii) an experimenter
to pinpoint, or induce, pathological scenarios in the system under study.
This includes the performance and correctness aspects of large-scale systems and networks
evaluation when subject to different conditions, workloads and fault patterns.

For more information please contact Professor Miguel Matos (miguel.marques.matos AT tecnico.ulisboa.pt).


==========
We seek
We are looking for a researcher with an independent mind who is willing to work on the
above topics and collaborate with a team of other researchers and students.
As background, we seek candidates with practical experience in the "system's side" of
designing and building distributed systems and networks.

The candidate should be proficient in written and spoken English.

As a research outcome, we expect publications in top-tier venues and (prototype) tools.


==========
We offer
- One Postdoc position for 30 months
- A stimulating scientific environment with English as a working language
- Full status as an employee including pension and health care benefits
- Longer term tenure-track positions are regularly open at Instituto Superior T¨¦cnico, University of Lisbon,
  which offer additional opportunities for those interested in pursuing a career in Lisbon
- Possibility to work with students at master's and Ph.D. level
