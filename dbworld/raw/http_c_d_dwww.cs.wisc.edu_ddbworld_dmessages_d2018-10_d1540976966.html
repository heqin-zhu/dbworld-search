Special Issue on Security and Privacy in Edge Computing-Assisted Internet of Things (IoT)


***** Extended deadline: November 15, 2018 *******


Cloud has been popularly used for handling computation-intensive tasks and providing intelligence to distributed IoT devices. However, as the number of Internet-connected devices is dramatically growing, cloud shows its limit on handling the daunting amount of computation loads on the one hand and the network bandwidth for moving huge volume of data from end devices to cloud becomes the bottleneck on the other hand. Edge computing is an emerging paradigm to optimize cloud-IoT ecosystems for tackling both network bottleneck and reducing data volume. The basic idea behind the edge computing lies in that the data processing such as analytics and knowledge generation are performed in the proximity of data origins. One can see edge devices as small-scale clouds providing comparatively limited functionality and capability, as compared to the centralized cloud. The use of edge devices in the proximity of data origins thus improves network latency. Moreover, the amount of data that need to be processed by each edge device will be substantially less than the amount of data that need to be processed by single cloud.


Despite numerous benefits from edge computing, this paradigm also brings new security and privacy challenges. While edge devices might be smartphones, smart gates, or even PC/laptop, together with the numerous kinds of end IoT devices such as smart watch (e.g., Apple iWatch), implantable medical devices (e.g., fitbit), voice assistants (e.g., Google Home), one can imagine various scenarios with sensitive data usage. For example, the smart watch collects sensitive physiological information. Meanwhile, distributed edge devices need to cooperate with each other without the involvement of the data center. These scenarios obviously result in a high concern of security and privacy, especially on, for example, access control of edge devices, data abuse/misuse, DoS resistance on edge devices.


The aim of this special issue is to collect recent research on security and privacy of edge computing, with particular emphasis on security and privacy issues on edge/end devices. More specifically, we invite recent advanced research on privacy enhancing technologies and secure cryptographic techniques to address security and privacy challenges in the field of edge computing.

The following themes are of particular interest:

Authentication, auditing and accountability in Edge Computing-Assisted IoT Edge computing architectures and solution design patterns Edge computing for IoT Communication and networking protocols for Edge Computing-Assisted IoT Fine-grained access control mechanism in Edge Computing-Assisted IoT Privacy-preserving computation in Edge Computing-Assisted IoT Trust and reputation issues in Edge Computing-Assisted IoT Security architecture for Edge Computing-Assisted IoT Key management in Edge Computing-Assisted IoT IoT communication in Edge Computing-Assisted IoT Incentive models or techniques for data processing in Edge Computing-Assisted IoT Privacy-Enhancing Cryptographic Techniques in Edge Computing-Assisted IoT Security for Crowdsourcing in Edge Computing-Assisted IoT
