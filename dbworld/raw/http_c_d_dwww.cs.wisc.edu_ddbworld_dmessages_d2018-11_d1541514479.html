Goal 
Nowadays a wide range of technological and pervasive applications has made available a huge 
amount of heterogeneous complex real data. Digging deep these data collections can unearth a rich 
spectrum of knowledge valuable to ultimately add intelligence in the targeted domains. However, 
data analytics on such collections is still a daunting task, because they are generally too big, dirty, 
complex, and heterogeneous to be processed through state-of-the-art data analysis techniques. 
Consequently, various data science challenges arise, tailored to each application domain, and 
dealing with the creation, storage, search, sharing, modelling, analysis, and visualization of data and 
their inner knowledge. 

The goal for this special issue is to explore how new emerging data science solutions and systems 
can help real-life settings to become smarter. Specifically, innovative contributions that either solve 
or advance the understanding of issues related to deploying data science technologies in the real 
world are very welcome. Interesting topics cover data analytics issues addressing all facets of the 
knowledge discovering process from the applied data-science perspective. The final goal is to 
disseminate cutting-edge applied research findings and industrial real-world advances on innovative 
data analytics methodologies and technologies to share data science innovation. 

Overview 
Due to the large amounts of data produced by modern and always connected industries and 
applications, the necessity of powerful and reliable architecture and methodologies to analyze data 
is becoming prominent. Furthermore, the recent expansion of IoT-enabled (Internet of Things) 
devices in a large variety of applications, from manufacturing contexts to food production and their 
subsequent data-driven needs, paved the way to the advent of the ?data-science anywhere? era. 

Data science is an interdisciplinary field about scientific processes, methodologies, and systems to 
extract useful knowledge or insights from data in various forms. Different and heterogenous analytic 
techniques, such as data mining, machine learning, statistics and optimization processes could be 
combined to discover interesting and hidden knowledge from complex heterogenous data. The real 
impact of those approaches is valuable when the proposed analytics methodologies are effectively 
exploited in real-life settings and the discovered knowledge effectively add intelligence to real 
systems. 

To this aim, algorithms are powerful tools to manage and analyze data. They are the way to fulfill 
the data science expectations, and although we barely notice them, they are behind a large part of 
the services we use every day. However, most algorithms, besides being precise and effective, are 
obscure and human unreadable. Making their choices and outcomes understandable and 
transparent would allow people to understand the reasons for algorithm choices, and thus improve 
their usability in various real-life settings. Therefore, transparent solutions are needed to produce 
more credible and reliable data analytics services, playing a key role in proactive user engagement 
by making the results of the data analytical process and its models widely accessible. 

The growing diffusion of many domains such as engineering and physical science is generating 
increasing opportunities to data scientists to exploit artificial intelligence in real-world problems and 
systems, through the analysis of real-world data that are complex in contents, heterogeneous in 
formats and often order of Terabytes in amount. New opportunities to work on exciting real-word 
problems and deal with complex and unexpected research issues arise. From the smart factory, filled 
with sensors over the whole production chain, to the more advanced IT services with huge amounts 
of log data, it is of paramount importance the ability to manage and elaborate data in both real time 
and off-line to discover useful knowledge for production process improvements and competitive 
business advantages. Thus, almost every application calls for data science solutions, algorithms, 
methodologies to enhance the quality of the provided services, add intelligence, advance the user 
needs with the ultimate goal to create new forms of business. 

In this scenario, new and exciting research issues should be faced. Heterogeneous data collected 
from different sources in real-life settings should be adequately combined, integrated and stored to 
ensure efficient and effective data analytics, knowledge exploration and understanding. Not only the 
heterogeneity of real-world data is a challenge, but also the increasing amount of data to be 
managed by machine learning techniques, as well as their poor quality. Additionally, increasing 
privacy awareness and transparency request for machine learning approaches call for data usage 
fairness in all business sectors. 

The general idea behind this special issue is to disseminate cutting-edge analytics contributions from 
various engineering, scientific and social settings that exploit data analytics, machine learning and 
data mining techniques. The special issue is expected to include papers that span a wide range of 
topics in the field of applied data science innovation, from methodological aspects, to theoretical 
and technological views. More specifically, this special issue covers some emerging and cutting-edge 
research topics concerning new trends in applied data analytics, such as transparency and fairness, 
new platforms for data handling, emerging hardware and software technologies for data discovery 
process, data analytics on novel architectures supporting compatibility with both on-premises and 
in-the-cloud environments, design and exploitation of reliable and largely supported Big Data 
platforms tailored to advanced machine learning techniques, and data science solutions. 

A variety of modern real-life settings along with academic contexts could benefit from the 
dissemination of those advances and novel paradigms covering all facets of the data discovery 
process. Industries and modern applications could share their experience on exploiting data 
analytics solutions keeping pace with the latest technologies. Academics could identify open 
research issues coming from the industrial and real-life contexts to continuously support the data 
discovery innovation process with the required methodological and technological solutions.
