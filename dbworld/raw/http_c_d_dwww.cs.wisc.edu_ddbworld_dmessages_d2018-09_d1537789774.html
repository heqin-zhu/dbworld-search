Cyber Security Cooperative Research Centre (CyberCRC)

The CyberCRC has been funded for 7 years by the Commonwealth Government?s Cooperative Research Centres Program 
and has also attracted significant funding from its participants.  The CyberCRC is an industry-driven collaboration 
to create and enhance Australian cyber security capability. With two research programs, ?Critical Infrastructure 
Security? and ?Cyber Security Solutions as a Service?, the CyberCRC will deliver innovative research, 
education and training outcomes that solve core challenges for public and private sector partners, with 
flow on effects for broader industry and community.  It will support the training and development of 
the future Australian cyber security workforce through traditional education programs with university and 
industry partners; cross-seed knowledge from a range of disciplines across industry and academia to 
influence innovative approaches to cyber security; and build awareness of cyber security habits and risks.  
The Cyber CRC has 25 participants which includes 19 industry and government entities and 6 universities.

The CyberCRC fosters collaboration with industry, academia, and government to deliver collaborative 
research outcomes articulated by industry and government. This research will solve real-world problems
 that organisations face today and that, in the future, we can deliver these solutions to industry, government 
and all Australians, while developing over the next 7 years the cyber security workforce of the future that 
will be embedded into our participant organisations.

CSIRO?s Data61 business unit is the largest data innovation group in Australia, bringing together 
approximately 600 research and development staff working in digital technologies to create benefit for Australia. 
Data61 develops Australia's future leaders with its strong 300+ PhD student program in collaboration with our best 
universities across Australia.
