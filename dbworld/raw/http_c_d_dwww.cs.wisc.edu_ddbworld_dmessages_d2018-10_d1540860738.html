=====================Overview=====================

Over the past decades, innovations have emerged from problem-oriented research based on knowledge integration at the intersection of different disciplines. Therefore, interdisciplinary collaboration has been critical to find solutions for complex societal challenges. However, there are little spaces within and beyond the academy where researchers are encouraged to defy their field's boundaries -leveraging their disciplinary mindset into contributions to broad domains, particularly within the Science, Technology, Engineering, Entrepreneurship, and Management (STEEM) and across Social Sciences and the Humanities.

ideas aims to stimulate novel questions and challenge existing policy and practices on more innovative and sustainable systems.  Throughout history, technological innovation has led to the most significant dimensions of development ¨C economic, social, and environmental - underpinning core changes in the way we live. In other words, we seek more efficient ways on how to transform research inputs into socioeconomic outputs.

Please forward this call to other people or groups you think may be interested. The full call for papers and further information on ideas 2019 are available here:
