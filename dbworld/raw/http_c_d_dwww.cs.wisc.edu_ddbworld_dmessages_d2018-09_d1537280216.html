Any kind of development is incomplete without the development in agriculture and in absence of natural 
resources. What will happen, if we have a developed the society in terms of information and infrastructure
 but no access to food or natural resources? We are experiencing a tremendous technology growth and 
evolution of innovative applications using Data Science and Big Data Analytics (BDA). 
Internet of Agriculture Things (AgThings) helps us to capture big data and in upcoming decade the 
farms will be a great source of data. The data obtained from farms can be used for precision agriculture
 and will help farmers or end users to take better decisions. The objective of workshop is to discuss 
the potential application areas of Data Science in Agriculture and Natural Resource Management domain. 
This workshop will demonstrate how data integration and analytics using data science can help farmers 
to increase their earnings and enable them to take better decisions. The agriculture and natural resource
 management sector needs keen attention of data science research community for finding innovative solutions 
to the problem of best utilization of natural resources and to increase the yield of agro-produces. 
Today, we are witnessing the information age and we have best time to make use of available voluminous, 
dynamic, and real time data for taking most efficient decisions for the management of natural resources 
and agricultural development. The objective of workshop is to provide a platform where researchers, 
academicians, professionals and practitioners can share state of the art technology for best utilization 
of natural resources and a highly productive environment for agriculture. The workshop is in conjunction 
with Big Data Analytics 2018 and it aims:

- To provide a forum where experts can discuss important contributions towards or research activities in the area of data science in Agriculture and Natural Resource Management.
- To discuss experimental research work in the area of Data Science, Big Data Analytics and Machine learning using any software libraries as well as BDA frameworks.
- To attract agro-experts and professionals to discuss hidden agriculture and farming patterns for the use of data in related domains.
- To discuss available datasets, acquisition, cleaning, integration and data analytics in agriculture and natural resource management.
- To discuss and identify relevant research issues for big data analytics and data science for agriculture and natural resource management.

The potential outcome of the workshop is to address challenges and issues related to Data Science in Agriculture 
and Natural Resource Management, data mining of weather or crop production data for estimation or prediction of 
disease, tools, data mining for the prediction models to solve the problem and develop frameworks for data mining
 in a specific domain of agricultural databases. We welcome the applications of data mining in spatial or 
agriculture as well as commodity market data analysis. We invite all researchers, scientists, professionals 
and academicians to share their interesting research, ideas, experience and results. The major topics related 
to large, complex, big data analytics and knowledge discovery are invited.
