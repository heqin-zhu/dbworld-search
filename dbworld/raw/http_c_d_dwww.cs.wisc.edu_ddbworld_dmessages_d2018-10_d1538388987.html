  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">     PHD RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP ON MINING SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORKS
   AT THE NORWEGIAN UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (NTNU)

One fully-funded 4-year PhD research fellowship is offered in the
Trondheim Analytica project (https://www.ntnu.edu/trondheimanalytica)
in the Department of Computer Science (<a href="http://www.ntnu.edu/idi">http://www.ntnu.edu/idi</a>) at NTNU.

The PhD candidate will develop frameworks and scalable techniques for
supporting analysis of social media data. Such data can typically be
represented as graph(s), consisting of both structured as well as
textual data. The successful PhD candidate will work with challenges
related to information analysis techniques on social media graphs.

Relevant background: a solid knowledge of algorithms, database
systems, information retrieval, or data mining is essential, and a
research-oriented master thesis within one of these or related areas
is expected. 

Since Trondheim is a bilingual city where almost everybody speaks and 
understands English fluently, candidates need not be afraid of a 
language barrier. The working language of the research group is 
English.
