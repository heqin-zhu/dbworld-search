  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">MIPR2019 Demonstration
The IEEE MIPR 2019 organizing committee invites proposals for technical demonstrations to be presented in conjunction with the conference. Technical Demonstrations will show leading edge work in any area of multimedia information retrieval. Demonstrations offer the opportunity to present and receive feedback on live working systems in an informal setting. Submissions are particularly encouraged in the following areas with emphasis on multimedia information retrieval, but not limited to:
? Retrieval: Multimedia Search and Recommendation, Web-Scale Retrieval, Relevance Feedback, Active/Transfer Learning, 3D and sensor data retrieval, Multimodal Media (images, videos, texts, graph/relationship) Retrieval, High-Level Semantic Multimedia Features, Summarization, Personalized Retrieval, Browsing History, Fuzzy Retrieval, Accuracy Measures for Retrieval
? Machine Learning/Deep Learning/Data Mining: Deep Learning in Multimedia Data and / or Multimodal Fusion, Deep Cross-Learning for Novel Features and Feature Selection, High- Performance Deep Learning (Theories and Infrastructures), Spatio-Temporal Data Mining
? Content Understanding and Analytics: Multimodal/Multisensor Integration and Analysis, Effective and Scalable Solution for Big Data Integration, Affective and Perceptual Multimedia, Multimedia/Multimodal Interaction Interfaces with humans
? Multimedia and Vision: Multimedia Telepresence and Virtual/Augmented/Mixed Reality, Visual Concept Detection, Object Detection and Tracking, 3D Modeling, Reconstruction, and Interactive Applications
? Fake Multimedia: Image / Video Forensics, Forgery Detection, Multimedia Content Protection
? Systems and Infrastructures: User Interfaces, Query-By-Retrieval Methods, Retrieval Paradigms,
Novel Interfaces for Retrieval, Multimedia Systems and Middleware, Telepresence and Virtual/Augmented/Mixed Reality, Software Infrastructure for Data Analytics, Distributed Multimedia Systems and Cloud Computing, GPU-based Retrieval
? Data Management: Multimedia Data Collections, Modeling, Indexing, or Storage, Data Integrity, Security, Protection, Privacy, Standards and Policies for Data Management, Spatio-Temporal Modeling and Retrieval
? Novel Applications: Multimedia Forensics and Security, Urban planning and emergency responses, Environmental monitoring, Education (using Multimedia for Education or Education about Multimedia), Social Networks (multimedia content), Multimedia Information Retrieval from Scientific Databases
? Internet of Multimedia Things: Real-Time Data Processing, Autonomous Systems such as Driverless Cars, Robots, and Drones, Mobile and Wearable Multimedia
The written and spoken language of IEEE MIPR 2019 is English. For technical demonstrations, authors should submit:
? a 4-page manuscript in double-column IEEE format including the authors' names and affiliations,
? a short abstract electronically, following the submission guidelines available on the IEEE MIPR 2019 web page, and
? a presentation/video, which can be a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation, a Flash presentation, an MPEG/WMV video clip, or a link on for the corresponding presentation on Social Media (e.g., vimeo, YouTube) not more than five minutes long.

Please create a single zip archive of all files, and upload it to the paper submission system. Only electronic submissions will be accepted. All technical demonstration papers should be in Adobe portable document format (PDF). The Conference Proceedings will be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press and be available for online access via IEEEXplore.
All submissions will be peer-reviewed to ensure quality. Demonstrators will be provided with space and access to a local network, however, demos should not rely on Internet access. The participants will be required to provide their own computing equipment and any additional network, display, or other specific hardware needed for the demonstration.
