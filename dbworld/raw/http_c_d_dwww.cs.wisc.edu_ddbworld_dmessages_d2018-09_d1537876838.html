  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">CFP: Special Issue of the Algorithms Journal on "MapReduce for Big Data"
<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/journal/algorithms/special_issues/MapReduce-Big-Data">http://www.mdpi.com/journal/algorithms/special_issues/MapReduce-Big-Data</a>

Dear Colleagues,

Data are becoming increasingly decisive resources in modern society. Big Data is an emerging paradigm encompassing various kinds of complex and large-scale information beyond the capability of conventional data-processing techniques. For example, one of the most important characteristics of Big Data is to carry out computing on petabyte (PB), and even exabyte (EB)-level data with a complex computing process. Therefore, massively parallel processing techniques, such as algorithms utilizing the cloud computing platforms MapReduce and Spark, are on demand.

The aim of this Special Issue is to invite high quality manuscripts that address challenges of Big Data with emerging computing platforms, such as MapReduce and Spark. We welcome original and unpublished manuscripts from academia and industry on the recent advances in different aspects of big data research and applications. Topics of interests include, but are not limited to: theoretical foundations of massively parallel computation, MapReduce algorithms for big data, and distributed algorithms for big graph processing.

Dr. Lijun Chang

Manuscript Submission Information

Manuscripts should be submitted online at www.mdpi.com by registering and logging in to this website. Once you are registered, click here to go to the submission form. Manuscripts can be submitted until the deadline. All papers will be peer-reviewed. Accepted papers will be published continuously in the journal (as soon as accepted) and will be listed together on the special issue website. Research articles, review articles as well as short communications are invited. For planned papers, a title and short abstract (about 100 words) can be sent to the Editorial Office for announcement on this website.

Submitted manuscripts should not have been published previously, nor be under consideration for publication elsewhere (except conference proceedings papers). All manuscripts are thoroughly refereed through a single-blind peer-review process. A guide for authors and other relevant information for submission of manuscripts is available on the Instructions for Authors page. Algorithms is an international peer-reviewed open access monthly journal published by MDPI.

Please visit the Instructions for Authors page before submitting a manuscript. The Article Processing Charge (APC) for publication in this open access journal is 850 CHF (Swiss Francs). Submitted papers should be well formatted and use good English. Authors may use MDPI's English editing service prior to publication or during author revisions.
