  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Dear Colleagues,

The Internet of Things (IoT) is the latest Internet evolution that incorporates billions of Internet-connected devices that range from cameras, sensors, RFIDs, smart phones, and wearables, to smart meters, vehicles, medication pills, signs and industrial machines. Such IoT things are often owned by different organizations and people who are deploying and using them for their own purposes. Federations of such IoT devices (referred to as IoT things) can also deliver timely and accurate information that is needed to solve internet-scale problems that have been too difficult to tackle before.

To realize its enormous potential, IoT must provide IoT solutions for discovering needed IoT devices, collecting and integrating their data, and distilling the high value information each application needs. Such IoT solutions must be capable of filtering, aggregating, correlating, and contextualizing IoT information in real-time, on the move, in the edge and the cloud, and securely and must be capable of introducing data-driven changes to the physical world.

The MDPI Sensors solicits paper submissions and aim to bring together researchers and application developers working on the intersection of IoT with next-generation sensor development, distributed, cloud, internet, mobile, ambient, semantic, real-time, secure and privacy-preserving computing. We also aim to explore the application of novel IoT computing results and describe and assess their impact..

Topics of Interest

Research topics of interest track include (but not necessary limited to these):

Development of smart IoT devices and robots that provide information from and perform actions in the IoT cyber-physical ecosystem
Discovery and integration of IoT devices and their data permitting the use of billions of IoT devices that have been deployed, owned, and controlled by others ? one of the major benefits of IoT
Real-time IoT data analysis on the cloud, at the edge, and on the move, including localisation, personalisation, and contextualisation of IoT data
IoT Security and privacy for IoT devices with limited computing resource and connectivity
IoT Actuation via IoT devices, robots and process-based automation
Lower-power and longer-range IoT networking for IoT devices
Wearable IoT devices and systems
Human performance monitoring, human/IoT integration, and IoT information visualisation
Application topics of interest include all aspects of, but not limited to:

Smart city services, including transportation, utilities, pollution management, and disaster management
Smart grids, including hybrid power stations and demand side management
Smart farming, including crop irrigation, fertilisation, and crop assessment and recommendation

Manuscript Submission Information

Manuscripts should be submitted online at www.mdpi.com by registering and logging in to this website. Once you are registered, click here to go to the submission form. Manuscripts can be submitted until the deadline. All papers will be peer-reviewed. Accepted papers will be published continuously in the journal (as soon as accepted) and will be listed together on the special issue website. Research articles, review articles as well as short communications are invited. For planned papers, a title and short abstract (about 100 words) can be sent to the Editorial Office for announcement on this website.

Submitted manuscripts should not have been published previously, nor be under consideration for publication elsewhere (except conference proceedings papers). All manuscripts are thoroughly refereed through a single-blind peer-review process. A guide for authors and other relevant information for submission of manuscripts is available on the Instructions for Authors page. Sensors is an international peer-reviewed open access monthly journal published by MDPI.

Please visit the Instructions for Authors page before submitting a manuscript. The Article Processing Charge (APC) for publication in this open access journal is 1800 CHF (Swiss Francs). Submitted papers should be well formatted and use good English. Authors may use MDPI's English editing service prior to publication or during author revisions.
