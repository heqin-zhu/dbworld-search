CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

The 11th International Conference on Brain Informatics (BI'18)

December 7-9, 2018, Arlington, Texas, USA
Homepage: <a href="http://uta.engineering/conferences/bi-2018/">http://uta.engineering/conferences/bi-2018/</a>

------------------------------------------------------
---Advancing BI Technologies from Basic Science Research to Real-World Practice--- 
------------------------------------------------------

The International Conference on Brain Informatics series (BI) 
has established itself as the world??s premier research forum 
that brings together researchers and practitioners from 
neuroscience, cognitive science, computer science, data science, 
artificial intelligence, information communication technologies, 
and neuroimaging technologies with the purpose of exploring the 
fundamental roles, interactions as well as practical impacts of 
Brain Informatics.

The BI'18 will provide a broad forum that academia, professionals 
and industry people can exchange their ideas, findings, and strategies 
in brain informatics research and brain-inspired concepts and 
technologies. It welcomes emerging technologies for addressing 
fundamental neurobiological questions about healthy brain function, 
laying the groundwork for advancing treatments for brain disorders 
or injury, and for generating brain-inspired "smart" artificial 
intelligence and computing technologies to meet future societal needs. 
It will educate and expand the brain informatics workforce and create 
new career opportunities for brain research and related innovations.
