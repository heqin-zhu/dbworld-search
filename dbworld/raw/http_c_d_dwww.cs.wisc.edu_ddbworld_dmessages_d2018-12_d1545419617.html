CALL FOR PAPERS

Natural Language Processing in Artificial Intelligence - NLPinAI 2019
19 - 21 February, 2019 - Prague, Czech Republic

<a href="http://www.icaart.org/NLPinAI.aspx">http://www.icaart.org/NLPinAI.aspx</a>

Paper Submission: December 27, 2018 (extended) 

New: There will be a post-conference, post-proceedings Special Issue with publications based on selected papers presented at NLPinAI 2019.

-------------------------------------------------------------
SCOPE:
Computational and technological developments that incorporate natural language are proliferating. Adequate coverage encounters difficult problems related to partiality, underspecification, and context-dependency, which are signature features of information in nature and natural languages. Furthermore, agents (humans or computational systems) are information conveyors, interpreters, or participate as components of informational content. Generally, language processing depends on agents' knowledge, reasoning, perspectives, and interactions.

The session covers theoretical work, applications, approaches, and techniques for computational models of information and its presentation by language (artificial, human, or natural in other ways). The goal is to promote intelligent natural language processing and related models of thought, mental states, reasoning, and other cognitive processes.

TOPICS:
We invite contributions relevant to the following topics, without being limited to them:

- Type theories for applications to language and information processing
- Computational grammar
- Computational syntax
- Computational semantics of natural languages
- Computational syntax-semantics interface
- Interfaces between morphology, lexicon, syntax, semantics, speech, text, pragmatics
- Parsing
- Multilingual processing
- Large-scale grammars of natural languages
- Interfaces between morphology, lexicon, syntax, semantics, speech, text, pragmatics
- Models of computation and algorithms for natural language processing
- Computational models of partiality, underspecification, and context-dependency
- Models of situations, contexts, and agents, for applications to language processing
- Information about space and time in language models and processing
- Models of computation and algorithms for linguistics
- Data science in language processing
- Machine learning of language
- Interdisciplinary methods
- Integration of formal, computational, model theoretic, graphical, diagrammatic, statistical, and other related methods
- Logic for information extraction or expression in written and spoken language
- Language processing based on biological fundamentals of information and languages
- Computational neuroscience of language

PAPER SUBMISSION:
Authors can submit their work in the form of a Regular Paper, representing completed and validated research, or as a Position Paper, for preliminary work in progress.

Regular Papers
- Submission: 
It is recommended that Regular Papers are submitted for review with around 8 to 10 pages
- Acceptance: 
After a double-blind peer review, qualifying Regular Papers may be accepted as either Full Papers or Short Papers
- Publication: 
Regular Papers classified as Full Papers will be assigned a 12-page limit in the Conference Proceedings, while Regular Papers classified as Short Papers have an 8-page limit

Position Papers
- Submission:  
Position Papers should be submitted for review with around 6 or 7 pages
- Acceptance:
After a double-blind peer review, qualifying Position Papers will be accepted as Short Papers
- Publication: Position Papers will be assigned a 8-page limit in the Conference Proceedings

Instructions for preparing the manuscript (in Word and Latex formats) are available at the page with paper Templates:

Please also check the Guidelines:

<a href="http://www.icaart.org/Guidelines.aspx">http://www.icaart.org/Guidelines.aspx</a>

Papers must be submitted electronically via the web-based submission system using the appropriated button Submit Paper on the pages of NLPinAI 2019.

The Conference Proceedings will be published under an ISBN number by SCITEPRESS and include final versions of all accepted papers, adjusted to satisfy reviewers' recommendations. They will be obtainable on paper and CD-Rom support, and made available for online consultation at the SCITEPRESS Digital Library. Online publication is exclusive to papers which have been both published and presented at the event.

Indexation: The proceedings will be submitted to Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index (CPCI/ISI), INSPEC, DBLP, EI (Elsevier Engineering Village Index) and Scopus for indexation.
