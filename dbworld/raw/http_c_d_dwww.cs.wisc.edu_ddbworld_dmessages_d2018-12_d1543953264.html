With the rise of social media, emoji have become an extremely popular form of communication. They are equally popular across major social media sites including Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. As of 2017, Facebook and Facebook Messenger process over 60 million and 6 billion messages with emoji per day, respectively. In 2015, Instagram reported that nearly half of the photo comments posted on Instagram contains emoji and Instagram users tend to replace slang terms using emoji in photo comments. Emoji data generated on social media sites have been utilized to study how emoji are used across different languages, cultures, user communities, and as features to learn machine learning models to solve problems that span across many applications, including sentiment analysis, emotion analysis, and sarcasm detection. The ability to automatically process, derive meaning, and interpret text fused with emoji will be essential as society embraces emoji as a standard form of online communication. Thus, this Special Issue on Emoji Understanding and Applications in Social Media seeks original research manuscripts dealing with computer and social science research efforts on understanding social, cultural, communicative, and linguistic roles of emoji and on building novel computational methods to understand, interpret, and exploit them. We encourage contributions on the challenges in emoji understanding and on applications that add to the scientific understanding, including but not limited to the following research topics:

Challenges in interpreting the meaning of an emoji in a message context 
Novel methods for emoji sense disambiguation 
Novel methods for calculating emoji similarity 
Novel methods for emoji prediction 
Challenges in using emoji as a language 
Emoji's effects on the evolution of language constructs used on social media such as emoticons and slang terms 
Common emoji usages in social media 
Cultural and community-specific emoji meaning evolution and interpretation 
Why emoji meanings change over time and across communities? 
Distinct social and communicative roles of emoji 
How do people come to understandings of the meanings of the emoji? 
Understanding sender intention and receiver interpretation of emoji 
Emoji rendering and interface design challenges 
Applications of emoji in social media 
Role of emoji in social media analysis tasks such as sentiment, emotion, and intent detection
Research related to other pictorial representations such as emoticons, kaomoji, emotes, customized emoji (e.g., bitmoji), and animated gifs.
Emoji and the law

We encourage submissions that utilize quantitative, qualitative and mixed research methods to approach the above challenges as contributions. Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for this special issue. Submissions will be evaluated by the program committee based on the quality of the work and its fit to the special issue themes. All submissions should be double-blind and use the latest ACM templates available at https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions for formatting. A high-resolution PDF of the paper should be uploaded to the submission site at https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/tsc before the paper submission deadline.
