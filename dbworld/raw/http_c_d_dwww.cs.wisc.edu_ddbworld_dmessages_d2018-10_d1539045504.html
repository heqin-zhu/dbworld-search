  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) was founded in 2009 as the fourth National Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea. Since its opening, UNIST has truly become one of world¡¯s leading science and technology universities, despite being younger than its peers.

The School of Management Engineering was established in 2016 based to counter a lack of related skills in the metropolitan city of Ulsan, the hub of Korean industry, where more than one million people are living. The school offers undergraduate, MSc, and PhD programs.

The School of Management Engineering is seeking applicants for several full-time, tenure-track or tenured faculty positions, expected to begin on March 2019. Appointments can be made at the Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Professor rank, commensurate with the individual's record. Candidates should have a PhD degree (or near completion of the degree for assistant professor-level applicants) in closely related disciplines (e.g., Industrial Engineering, Statistics, Computer Science) and demonstrate a strong competence in both research and teaching. Our hiring philosophy is that instead of simply counting the number of publications, we seek applicants with academic intelligence, integrity, grit, and potential for excellent research and educational achievement.
 

¡¤ Methodological/theoretical areas of interest include but are not limited to artificial intelligence, machine learning, optimization, data science, and blockchain.

¡¤ Application domains of interest include but are not limited to logistics, production/manufacturing, and security.

¡¤ Academic or industrial experience of R&amp;D projects will be considered preferably, as the school provides numerous opportunities for R&amp;D work with industry and government.

The university is offering competitive compensation package. Faculty members at UNIST receive the highest level of starting salaries among the national universities in Korea. Faculty members also receive generous start-up research grants and comprehensive benefits including on-campus modern housing and moving expenses. A children day care center is available on campus. Teaching load is nine credits per year (three courses usually).

Interested candidates should apply electronically via <a href="http://invite.unist.ac.kr">http://invite.unist.ac.kr</a>. Candidates should provide (i) a current C.V., (ii) a list of references, (iii) one page summary statements describing research and teaching plans, and (iv) copies of at most five prominent research results. Please visit the websites at https://sme.unist.ac.kr/ for the information about the School of Management Engineering.

Faculty members from the school will be available to meet candidates at the INFORMS Annual Meeting in Phoenix. Please contact Professor Sungil Kim at sungil.kim@unist.ac.kr. Candidates should reach out to the committee prior to October 31 to be considered for one of these interviews.
