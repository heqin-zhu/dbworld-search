IMPORTANT DATES
Submission deadline: Feb. 1, 2019

Notification: Mar. 1, 2019

Camera-ready copy: Mar. 15, 2019

Workshop date: May 27, 2019


SCOPE

Healthcare systems in many countries are leveraging emerging technologies (e.g., cloud computing, mobile apps, data science, biosensors, and wearable devices) and modern software engineering approaches to ensure continuous quality improvement in the presence of rapid change and increasing challenges. Software-intensive systems are seen as a key enabler for healthcare system reform in many jurisdictions with major investments and incentives to propel this transformation. At the same time, interoperability barriers continue to impede adoption, especially in the context of complex care where different types of healthcare providers from different organizations need to collaborate.

This workshop will provide a forum where students, researchers, and practitioners from software engineering, health informatics, and medical domains will be able to discuss the design,

evaluation, and evolution of software systems in healthcare, disseminating standards, methods, models and techniques that will help to shape the next generation of such systems, especially in regard to safety, data governance, and sustainability.


TOPICS

The workshop is focused on, but not limited to the following topics:

Software engineering: methods and techniques for modeling, designing, developing, and evaluating healthcare systems, software architectures, reference architectures, software product lines, context awareness and autonomous computing, technical debt, software quality, development processes, user interfaces, systems interoperability, cloud native applications, safety, security, sustainability, data governance, workflow integration, compliance and regulatory issues, and data analytics;

Healthcare systems: eHealth, mHealth, telehealth, electronic health records systems, medical devices, biomedical data, healthcare performance management, quality of care, medication adherence and health monitoring, electronic prescription, health care management systems, ageing users, standards, and clinical decision support.

We look for papers that explore the above topics and the role that Software engineering plays in creating solutions to address them. We are expressly interested in submissions from researchers in developing and underserved countries. We are also particularly interested in emerging trends in current practice submitted by those working in the healthcare domain.


SUBMISSION
Three types of submissions are invited:

*Technical papers limited to 8 pages, presenting novel or tailored methods, processes, and tools

*Case studies limited to 4 pages, reporting experiments and/or industry experiences; and

*Short papers limited to 4 pages, reporting preliminary results of ongoing studies, emerging trends in current practice, or identifying relevant challenges.

The page limit includes all text, figures, tables, and references. All submissions must be unpublished original work and not be under review elsewhere. All papers will be judged on the basis of their clarity, relevance, originality, and applicability in practice.

Formatting and Submission Links: All submissions must be in English, formatted according to the ICSE 2019 Format and Submission Guidelines:

** All submissions must conform to the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTEX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf option).

** Works must be submitted in PDF format via EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=seh2019.


PUBLICATION OF PAPERS
Accepted papers will be published in the electronic ICSE 2019 Proceedings in the IEEE Digital Library. The official publication date of the workshop proceedings is the date the proceedings are made available by IEEE. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of ICSE 2019. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.
