  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If you are working on a data science related research project, then I encourage you to submit a poster proposal to the 2019 Southern Data Science Conference (SDSC). Here are the details:

SDSC 2019
Poster Proposal Submission Deadline: Jan 24, 2019
https://www.southerndatascience.com/submission-guidline

Recent already published work can be presented. There is no double submission policy. Poster presenters will be required to attend the Poster Session at a specified time to discuss the work with conference attendees. The poster session will allow the presenter to interact with interested parties in a casual setting to share information and ideas. Selected poster presenters will receive FREE conference admission for the first (student) author!

   <petra.kralj.novak@ijs.si>
