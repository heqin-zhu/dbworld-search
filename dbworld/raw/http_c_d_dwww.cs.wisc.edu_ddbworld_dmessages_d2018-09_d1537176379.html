*** Aim &amp; Scope ***
Aim of the Knowledge and Language Processing (KLP) track at ACM SAC is to investigate techniques and application of knowledge engineering and natural language processing, focusing in particular on approaches combining them. This is an extremely interdisciplinary emerging research area, at the core of Artificial Intelligence, combining and complementing the scientific results from Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Representation and Reasoning.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- NLP for Knowledge
---- NLP tasks for Knowledge Extraction
---- NLP for Implicit Knowledge
---- NLP for Ontology Population and Learning
---- Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining for Knowledge Applications
---- Interplay between Language Resources and Ontologies
---- NLP for Explainable Knowledge
---- NL Generation from Structured Information and Linked Data
---- Machine Translation techniques for Multi-lingual Knowledge
---- NLP for the Web
- Knowledge for NLP
---- Knowledge to improve NLP tasks
---- Knowledge for Information Retrieval
---- Knowledge-based Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining
---- Ontologies for Language
---- Combining Knowledge and Deep Learning for NLP
---- Knowledge for Text Summarization and Generation
---- Knowledge for Persuasion
---- Knowledge-based Machine Translation
---- Knowledge for the Web
---- Linked Data for NLP
- Knowledge and NLP Applications
---- Real-world applications that exploit Knowledge and NLP
---- Knowledge and NLP Systems for Big Data scenarios
---- Deployment of Knowledge and NLP Systems in specific domains. For example:
------- Digital Humanities and Social Sciences
------- eGovernment and public administration
------- Life sciences, health and medicine
------- News and Data Streams


*** Paper Submission ***
Research papers and experience reports related to the above topics are solicited. Submissions must not have been published or be concurrently considered for publication elsewhere. Papers should be submitted in PDF using the ACM-SAC proceedings format using the submission link on the SAC 2019 website (https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2019). Authors' names and affiliations should be entered separately at the submission site and not appear in the submitted papers. Each submission will be reviewed in a DOUBLE-BLIND process according to the ACM-SAC Regulations. Student Research Competition (SRC) submissions are welcome (see SAC 2019 website for details).

Full papers are limited to 8 pages, in camera-ready format, included in the registration fee. Authors have the option to include up to two (2) extra pages (paying an extra charge). 
Posters are limited to 3 pages, in camera-ready format, included in the registration fee. Authors have the option to include only one (1) extra page (paying an extra charge).
SRC Abstracts are limited to 4 pages, in camera-ready format, included in the registration fee. No extra pages allowed.

Paper selection is based on the originality, technical contribution, presentation quality, and relevance to the Knowledge and Language Processing Track. Some papers may be accepted as posters.

Authors of selected papers of the Knowledge and Language Processing track will be invited to submit an extended version of their work to a Special Issue on Information Processing &amp; Management Journal.
