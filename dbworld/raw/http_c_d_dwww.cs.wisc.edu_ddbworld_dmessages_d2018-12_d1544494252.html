====================================DESCRIPTION=========================================================================
Most multimedia objects are spatio-temporal simulacrums of the real world. This supports our view that the next grand challenge 
for our community will be understanding and formally modeling the flow of life around us, over many modalities and scales. As 
technology advances, the nature of these simulacrums will evolve as well, becoming more detailed and revealing more information
concerning the nature of reality to us.

Currently, IoT is the state-of-the-art organizational approach to construct complex representations of the flow of life around us. 
Various, perhaps pervasive, sensors, working collectively, will broadcast to us representations of real events in real-time. It 
will be our task to continuously extract the semantics of these representations and possibly react to them by injecting some 
response actions into the mix to ensure some desired outcome.

In linguistics, pragmatics studies context and how it affects semantics. Context is usually culturally, socially, and historically 
based. For example, pragmatics would encompass a speaker¡¯s intent, body language, and penchant for sarcasm, as well as other signs,  
often culturally based, such as the speaker¡¯s type of clothing, which could influence a statement¡¯s meaning. Generic signal/sensor- 
based retrieval should also use syntactical, semantic, and pragmatics-based approaches. If we are to understand and model the flow 
of life around us, this will be a necessity.

Our community hSecas successfully developed various approaches to decode the syntax and semantics of these artifacts. The development 
of techniques that use contextual information is in its infancy, however. With the expansion of the data horizon, through the 
ever-increasing use of metadata, we can certainly leverage the semantic representation of all media to a more robust level.

The NLP community has its own set of approaches in semantics and pragmatics. Natural language is certainly an excellent exemplar of 
multimedia, and the use of audio and text features has played a part in the development of our field.

After a successful first workshop in Miami, we intend to continue this tradition with the second workshop.
