Online CFP: 
https://turing.manhattan.edu/~ankur.agrawal/workshop/bibm2018.html

Due date for submissions: Sept 30, 2018 

The 1st International Workshop on Quality Assurance of Biological and Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies will be held in Madrid, Spain (December 3 - 6, 2018) in conjunction with IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine.

Overview:
    Ontologies and terminologies provide structured and unambiguous ways of representing domain information in biology and biomedicine. Examples of biological and biomedical ontologies and terminologies include SNOMED CT, Gene Ontology, Chemical Entities of Biological Interest, Foundational Model of Anatomy, and Logical Observation Identifier Names and Codes. They have served as knowledge sources for a wide range of biomedical applications including data integration and exchange, natural language processing, and decision support and reasoning. 

    These ontologies and terminologies tend to be large in size and regularly maintained through revisions and modifications in their lifecycle which may result in errors such as ambiguity, redundancy and modeling inconsistencies. As such, quality assurance of these ontologies and terminologies become important as they impact all the downstream applications that rely on them, and they may be used in applications that can affect patient-care such as in electronic health records and in clinical decision support systems. 

    The goal of this workshop is to bring together data analysts and researchers in the field of Bioinformatics, Biomedicine and Healthcare Informatics to discuss the role, importance, approaches and methods for quality assurance of biological and biomedical ontologies and terminologies. 

Scope:
    The topics of this workshop include but are not limited to the following:
        Novel methodologies for efficient and effective quality assurance of ontologies and terminologies
        Algorithms for identifying errors or problematic areas within the ontologies and terminologies
        Structural and lexical methods for quality assurance of ontologies and terminologies
        Contextual and group auditing methods for quality assurance of ontologies and terminologies
        Leveraging machine learning and natural language processing in quality assurance of ontologies and terminologies
        Cross-ontology-based methods for quality assurance of ontologies and terminologies
        Methods to evaluate the quality of ontologies and terminologies
        Review of existing methods of quality assurance of ontologies and terminologies
        Applications that can assist in the quality assurance of ontologies and terminologies such as utilizing crowdsourcing methods or using visualization
