About Reykjavik, Iceland:
Ranked the happiest and safest place in the world, Iceland offers unsurpassed opportunities for seeing nature at work, with its mix of glaciers, hot springs, lava fields and expanses of lunar-like landscape. Reykjavik is a family friendly city, with many opportunities for leisure activities and good infrastructure for children. Reykjavik has a mild climate, with temperatures dropping seldom far below freezing point. Reykjavik is one of the most connected cities in the world with daily direct flights to most major cities in north America and Europe. The city is known for its vibrant cultural scene that is seldom seen in cities of its size. 
 
The Icelandic society is innovative and practically minded. Collaboration between researchers, industry, and administration is uncomplicated. Reykjavik University is located on the south shore of the city, next to a heated beach, park, and by several outdoors trails along the sea and towards the mountains.
