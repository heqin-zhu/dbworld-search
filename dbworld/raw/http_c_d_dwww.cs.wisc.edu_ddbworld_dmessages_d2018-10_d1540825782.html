One fully-funded 3-year PhD position fellowship is offered in the ANR-Polluscope project (<a href="http://polluscope.uvsq.fr">http://polluscope.uvsq.fr</a> ) in the Department of Computer Science at UVSQ , a founding member of Universit¨¦ Paris_Saclay - www.uvsq.fr

The PhD proposal is part of the ANR-Polluscope project which relies on the emerging wearable connected sensors, providing the opportunity for monitoring actual personal exposure to air pollution wherever throughout her/his daily activity. The goal of Polluscope is to evaluate on the ground the capacities and the limitations of these sensors in fine-grained understanding of personal exposure to air pollutants, as well as their health impacts, notably for asthmatic and COPD subjects. 
The PhD candidate will develop data mining methods adapted to opportunistic samples of sensor geodated series along with associated contextual data on the one hand, and studying multi-dimensional exploratory analysis and aggregation of such data on the other hand.

Relevant background: a solid knowledge of algorithms, database systems, information retrieval, data mining or machine learning is essential, and a research-oriented master thesis within one of these or related areas is expected. 

The PhD candidate will join ADAM (Ambiant Data Access and Mining) research team within DAVID Lab (www.david.uvsq.fr). Since in ADAM research team, almost everybody speaks and understands English fluently, candidates need not be afraid of a language barrier. Both French and English are the working languages of ADAM research team. 

For more information, please contact Prof. Karine Zeitouni (karine.zeitouni@uvsq.fr) and Dr. Yehia Taher (yehia.taher@uvsq.fr)
