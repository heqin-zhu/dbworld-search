TrustCom 2019 Call For Papers 

In a fast-growing cyber security threat landscape, game-changing techniques in information security, trust, privacy and forensics are required for a sustainable future.?CROW?and?STRATUS?are proud to host the 18th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications (IEEE TrustCom-19) which will be held at Rotorua, New Zealand on 5-8 August 2019.

As a leading international conference in the area of trust, information security and privacy, and forensics, the IEEE TrustCom 2019 conference aims to bring together international researchers and practitioners working on trusted computing and communications, with regard to trust, security, privacy, reliability, dependability, survivability, availability, and fault tolerance aspects of computer systems and networks ? providing a forum to present and discuss emerging ideas and trends in this highly challenging research field.

Submission Guidelines
Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings. Papers must be clearly presented in English, must not exceed 8 pages, including tables, figures, references and appendixes, in IEEE Computer Society proceedings format with Portable Document Format (.pdf). Please submit your paper via https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ieeetrustcom2019

Papers will be selected based on their originality, timeliness, significance, relevance, and clarity of presentation. Submission of a paper should be regarded as a commitment that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will register and attend the conference to present the work. Accepted and presented papers will be included in the IEEE CPS Proceedings. Distinguished papers presented at the conference, after further revision, will be recommended to high quality international journals.
