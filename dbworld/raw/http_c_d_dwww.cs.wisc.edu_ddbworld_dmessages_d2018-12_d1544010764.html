Call for Papers 

This symposium aims at gathering researchers from the fields of wireless networking and Internet applications to discuss new opportunities and hurdles to leverage the possibilities of new applications and services for the Internet of Ubiquitous and Pervasive Things.

The new developments in this area raise many research questions including interaction, security, collaboration, context, discovery, and privacy of physical things in the virtual world. Despite the tremendous progress in Internet technologies the research community continues to wrestle with some of these questions. This symposium focuses on disseminating novel ideas and research directions in this fast emerging area of the Internet of Things. This symposium also aims to bring together academics and practitioners in an effort to highlight the state-of-the-art and discuss the issues and opportunities to explore new research directions and develop new ideas for the Internet of Things. The symposium will be platform to provide opportunities for researchers from academia and industry to join hands, exchange ideas and focus on solutions that will enhance the life of the growing population on the Internet. It will lead to identifying new directions and setting the scope for developm!
 ents in this area. The participants will be enlightened with intellectual discussions, highlighting the advances in technology that bridges the physical world and the digital world.

The 9th International Symposium on Internet of Ubiquitous and Pervasive Things will take place in conjunction with the 10th International Conference on Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies(ANT 2019) from April 29 to May 2, 2019, in Leuven, Belgium.
