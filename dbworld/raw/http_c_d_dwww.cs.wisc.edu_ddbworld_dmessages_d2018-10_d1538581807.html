Workshop on Big Data for Cybersecurity (BigCyber 2018)
https://bigcyber2018.umbc.edu/

Paper submission: https://wi-lab.com/cyberchair/2018/bigdata18/scripts/submit.php?subarea=S34&amp;undisplay_detail=1&amp;wh=/cyberchair/2018/bigdata18/scripts/ws_submit.php

in conjunction with the 2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE Big Data 2018), 
December 10-13, 2018, Seattle, WA, USA
Paper Submission Deadline: October 10, 2018
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Security analysts need to process high velocity and veracious data for early detection of cybersecurity events, such as attacks, data-theft, etc. The problem is challenging given the constantly evolving threat landscape. Even with advanced monitoring, sophisticated persistent attackers can spend as many as 146 days in a system before being detected. Existing systems? lack of unified organizational view causes information flooding and overwhelms a security analyst with false alarms. We need techniques that reduces an analyst?s cognitive load. 

Big data crossing the organizational boundary even in mid-size environments, need to be mined, examined, analyzed to create ?Analyst Augmentation Systems? which will aid security analysts in their day to day operations. 

This workshop aims to bring together researchers from Cybersecurity and Big Data to help further homeland security?s missions of anticipation, interdiction, prevention, preparedness, and response. We invite submissions in areas (but not limited to) related to knowledge extraction from cybersecurity intelligence big datasets, fast analysis of security datasets for relevant information, and using this knowledge for various cybersecurity activities like early attack detection, mitigation, remediation, and forensics.

Big data and Cybersecurity research is an interdisciplinary research field involving researchers in information technologies, computer science, public policy, computational social science, social computing, and social and behavioural studies as well as local, state, and federal law enforcement and intelligence experts, and information technology industry consultants and practitioners.
