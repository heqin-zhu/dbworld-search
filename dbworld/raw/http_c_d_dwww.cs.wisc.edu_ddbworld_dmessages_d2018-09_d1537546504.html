  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Faculty of Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering at Graz University of Technology, Austria offers two open PhD positions in the BMVIT endowed and recently created group for Data Management at the Institute of Interactive Systems and Data Science. These research assistant positions are fully funded for 5 years, 40 hours per week, with a gross salary of at least ?2,794.60 (14? yearly).

Mission Statement:
The data management for data science group (DAMS lab) aims to simplify data science by providing high-level, data-science-centric abstractions and building systems and tools to efficiently execute these tasks. Our major focus areas are:
* ML Systems Internals: Advanced compilation, runtime, and storage techniques for machine learning (ML) systems are the key to achieve both high-level yet flexible abstractions as well as efficiency and scalability.   
* Data Systems Integration: Simplifying data science end-to-end, further requires advancements in data integration, cleaning and preparation, as well as a seamless integration with data systems.
* Seamless Deployment and Usage: The deployment of ML models in production pipelines faces often neglected challenges such as efficient embedded execution, explainability via provenance, result consistency and compliance rules, as well as error analysis support.  

Positions:
* 1x ML System Compiler and Runtime Techniques (ID 7060/18/018)
* 1x Data Integration, Preprocessing, and Provenance (ID 7060/18/019)

Requirements:
We expect a successfully completed master or diploma degree in computer science or related fields, good English language skills (fluently spoken and written), and a great interest in applied, systems-oriented research in the context of data and ML systems. We offer an inspiring research environment, highly practical research questions, and the integration into a diverse team of researchers and developers. Research assistants are expected to pursue their PhD studies, explore and address open research questions, and support teaching and the supervision of bachelor and master theses.

Important Dates:
* Application Deadline: Oct 10, 2018
* Starting Date: Nov 1, 2018 (preferred)

Application Process:
