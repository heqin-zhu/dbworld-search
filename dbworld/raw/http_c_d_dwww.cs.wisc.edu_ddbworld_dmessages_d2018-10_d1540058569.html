     The Eleventh NASA Formal Methods Symposium     

 https://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/R2/pages/nfm2019.html

                   7 - 9 May 2019                   
        Rice University, Houston, Texas, USA       
****************************************************


Theme of the Symposium:
-----------------------
The widespread use and increasing complexity of mission-critical and safety-critical systems at NASA and in the aerospace industry require advanced techniques that address these systems' specification, design, verification, validation, and certification requirements. The NASA Formal Methods Symposium (NFM) is a forum to foster collaboration between theoreticians and practitioners from NASA, academia, and industry. NFM's goals are to identify challenges and to provide solutions for achieving assurance for such critical systems.    

New developments and emerging applications like autonomous software for uncrewed deep space human habitats, caretaker robotics, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), UAS Traffic Management (UTM), and the need for system-wide fault detection, diagnosis, and prognostics provide new challenges for system specification, development, and verification approaches. The focus of these symposiums are on formal techniques and other approaches for software assurance, including their theory, current capabilities and limitations, as well as their potential application to aerospace, robotics, and other NASA-relevant safety-critical systems during all stages of the software life-cycle.

The NASA Formal Methods Symposium is an annual event organized by the NASA Formal Methods (NFM) Steering Committee, comprised of researchers spanning several NASA centers. NFM 2019 (https://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/R2/pages/nfm2019.html) is being co-organized by Rice University and NASA- Johnson Space Center in Houston, TX.

Topics of Interest:
-------------------
We encourage submissions on cross-cutting approaches that bring together formal methods and techniques from other domains such as probabilistic reasoning, machine learning, control theory, robotics, and quantum computing among others. 
    * Formal verification, including theorem proving, model checking, and static analysis
    * Advances in automated theorem proving including SAT and SMT solving
    * Use of formal methods in software and system testing
    * Run-time verification
    * Techniques and algorithms for scaling formal methods, such as abstraction and symbolic methods, compositional techniques, as well as parallel and/or distributed techniques
    * Code generation from formally verified models 
    * Safety cases and system safety
    * Formal approaches to fault tolerance
    * Theoretical advances and empirical evaluations of formal methods techniques for safety-critical systems, including hybrid and embedded systems
    * Formal methods in systems engineering and model-based development
    * Correct-by-design controller synthesis
    * Formal assurance methods to handle adaptive systems

There will be no registration fee for participants. All interested individuals, including non-US citizens, are welcome to attend, to listen to the talks, and to participate in discussions; however, all attendees must register.


Submission Details:
-------------------
There are two categories of submissions:

   1. Regular papers describing fully developed work and complete results (15 pages + references)
   2. Two categories of short papers: (6 pages + references) 
   (a) Tool Papers describing novel, publicly-available tools
   (b) Case Studies detailing complete applications of formal methods to real systems with publicly-available artifacts 

All papers should be in English and describe original work that has not been published or submitted elsewhere. All submissions will be fully reviewed by members of the Programme Committee. Papers will appear in a volume of Springer's Lecture Notes on Computer Science (LNCS), and must use LNCS style formatting. Papers should be submitted in PDF format here: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nfm2019.
