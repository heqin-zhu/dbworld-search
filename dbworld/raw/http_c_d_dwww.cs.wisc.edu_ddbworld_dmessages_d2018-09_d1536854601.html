Call for Papers


Aim and Scope:
-----------------

It is all good to have access to large volume of data generated with high velocity which normally spans variety of domains and usually comes with levels of veracity.  However, the importance of data becomes visible only when we turn it into a value. In particular, in the domain of ?Big Spatial Data?, we deal with massive amounts of real-time spatial and spatio-temporal data obtained from billions of sensors, location-aware devices, remoting sensing satellites, and various models of the physical world. The use of Big Spatial Data spans a variety of applications including social networks, earth sciences, transportation, communication networks, online maps, smart cities and urban planning, remote sensing, and crisis and evacuation management, to name but a few. Turning Big Spatial Data into value is challenging and requires introduction of fundamentally new spatio-temporal algorithms, methods, and systems that can process, mine, and analyze massive amounts of fast and heterogeneous spatio-temporal data in a timely manner.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers from academia, government and industry who are actively addressing problems in the area of Big Spatial Data management and analysis. This workshop offers the audience the opportunity to discuss the lessons which they have learned over the years, to demonstrate what they have achieved so far, and to plan for the future of ?Big Spatial Data?. We encourage researchers from academia and industry to submit papers that highlight the value of Big Spatial Data processing, management, mining, and analysis on topics that include, but are not limited to the following:

* Big Spatial Data: Management  
* Big Spatial Data: Mining and Analysis 
* Big Spatial Data: API services
* Big Spatial Data: Stream Processing 
* Big Spatial Data: Privacy and Authentication. 
* Big Spatial Data: Predictive Models 
* Big Spatial Data: Geosensing 
* Big Geospatial Information Retrieval and Crowdsourcing 
* Big Geosocial Networks
* Big Spatial Data: Indexing
* Big Spatial Data: Modern Hardware, High Performance Computing, and Cloud
* Big Spatial Data: Visualization 
* Big Spatial Data: Deep Learning 
* Big Spatial Data: Fundamentals and Theory 
* Big Spatial Data: NoSQL and NewSQL Data Stores
* Big Spatial Data: Applications


Paper Submission:
------------------------

Authors with interests in any of the listed topics or any other topic related to Big Spatial Data paradigm are cordially invited to submit their work. All submissions should be in high quality, original and not published or under review elsewhere during the review process.

Submitted papers have to follow the IEEE official template. Maximum paper length allowed is: 

Full Papers: 10 pages
Short (work-in-progress) Papers: 4 pages
Demo Papers: 4 pages
Position/Vision Papers: 4 pages

If from last three categoizes listed above, the title of the paper should start with ?Short Paper:?, ?Demo Paper:?, or ?Vision Paper:?, respectively. Submitted papers will be reviewed by members of the Workshop Program Committee.  At least one author for each accepted paper has to register and present the work.
