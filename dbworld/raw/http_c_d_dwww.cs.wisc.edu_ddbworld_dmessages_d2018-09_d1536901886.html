  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">We invite candidates for PhD student and Postdoc positions to start
in 2018 or early 2019 in Innsbruck. The 5-year ERC project "SMART"
aims to combine modern machine learning techniques with formal
reasoning to provide proof advice and assistance.

The starting date can be negotiated. PhD student positions like Postdoc
positions are formal employment in Austria, with a regular salary and
benefits.

A background in machine learning, or formal proof is an advantage.
Knowledge of German is not required, the group is international and
the language of communication is English.

Candidates for a PhD position must hold a MSc in computer science or
mathematics and candidates for the postdoctoral position hold a PhD
degree in computer science or mathematics.

Applications and informal inquiries are welcome, please contact
Cezary Kaliszyk (cezary.kaliszyk@uibk.ac.at). Applications should
include a CV and names and contact details of two references.
For the Postdoc positions please include a brief research statement.

The city of Innsbruck, which hosted the Olympic Winter Games in 1964,
1976 and 2012 (YOG), is superbly located in the beautiful surroundings
of the Tyrolean Alps. The combination of the Alpine environment and
urban life in this historic town provides a high quality of living.
