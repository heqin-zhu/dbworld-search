CALL FOR PAPERS
***************
The rich proliferation of many social media platforms is widely by used people on smartphone devices all over the world. At the same time, the incremental data of online social networks (e.g., Facebook), microblogs (e.g., Twitter), multi-media sites (e.g., YouTube, Instagram) and user review sites (e.g., Yelp) are imposing new challenges for the efficient data management and analysis query processing. On one hand, online social networks are undergoing rapid changes, not only on the dynamic graph structure, but also in the new information of updating user profiles, new hashtags in posters, as well as breakthrough events. On the other hand, the size of social media data is becoming bigger and bigger due to, e.g., the explosion of new posters and also the massive amount of users. Utilizing new technologies for efficient handling big social media data management is of urgent importance. However, numerous essential issues in this area have yet to be explored, including data crawling and modeling, storage, indexes, querying and mining, privacy, and so on.

The 2018 International Workshop on Big Social Media Data Management and Analysis (BSMDMA2018) aims to provide a forum for presenting the most recent advances in most recent advances in data management and mining on online social media, related to web search and information retrieval, social network analysis, visualization and summarization, and network science. The BSMDMA2018 will be in conjunction with 2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE Big Data 2018) on December 10-13, 2018, Seattle, WA, USA. We are particularly interested in articles that address how to handle query processing on large-scale and dynamic social media data as well as their novel applications for social media platforms. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
*********************
The workshop accepts poster papers (2-4 pages) and full research papers (up to 10 pages). Paper submissions should be formatted according to the IEEE conference template. All submissions should clearly present the author information including the names of the authors, the affiliations and the emails. The review process is single-blinded. Papers must be submitted electronically as PDF files to BSMDMA2018 workshop at IEEE Big Data 2018 through CyberChair.

Submissions must be original (not previously published and not under review in other forums). Authors are advised to interpret these limitations strictly and to contact the organizers in case of doubt. Each accepted paper must be accompanied by at least one full registration, and an author is expected to present the paper at the conference, otherwise, the paper will be removed from the proceedings. All accepted papers will be EI-indexed.
