Title : Detection of suspicious goods in maritime transportation

Description :
The SHAMAN team of the IRISA laboratory is involved in a project with three companies: SEMSOFT, CLS and HSBC, whose final goal is to automate the control process of goods shipped accross the seas. The functional objective is to identify suspicious goods, containers, boats, shipping companies, etc. based on the analysis of data aggregated by SEMSOFT and CLS about loadings, unloadings, boats positions, etc.

Qualifying objects (goods, containers, boats, shipping companies, etc.) as normal vs. suspicious may be seen as a classical classification process (e.g. using decision trees). But the particularity of the approach to develop is to take into account subjective and expert knowledge about the applicative context to influence and explain the decision taken by the classification process. The SHAMAN team is specialized in the modeling of such subjective and contextual knowledge (user vocabulary, expert rules, etc.) using the fuzzy set theory. The final objective of the project is to compare/complete/understand decision taken based on subjective knowledge and decision taken using an automatic classification technic. 

The hired colleague will work with permanent members of the SHAMAN team on the modeling of the rules generally used by maritime controlers to identify suspicious events and their use during the classification process. The second goal is to generate meaningful explanations about the origin of the raised alerts to improve their acceptance by the human controller. In this sense, this last task may be seen as a will to make classification processes more understandable.


Required Profile PhD in data &amp; knowledge management. More precisely, we expect the candidate to be knowledgeable about: the RDF framework, graphs, reasoning using decision trees, expert systems, generalization by entailment, clustering.
We also expect the hired colleague to have strong programming skills.
