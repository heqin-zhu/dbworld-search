  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Dear Colleagues,


Please find below the call for chapters for "Recent Developments on Industrial Control Systems Resiliency".


This book scope is to build a practical guideline for analyzing, evaluating and designing resilient industrial control systems.
Since industrial control systems (ICS) are a key component of almost every existing critical infrastructure, they should be designed to be resilient. This means that the ICS should be capable to recover from various process faults and failures and to withstand to recently developed cyberattacks.
The book is addressed to researchers, Ph.D. students, and specialists in process control and cybersecurity and is expected to be published by Springer.

The book is intended to include case studies, design examples, simulation, reviews and overviews.

Book editors:

? Dr. Emil Pricop
Petroleum-Gas University of Ploiesti, Ploiesti, Romania emilpricop@ieee.org
? Dr. Jaouhar Fattahi
Laval University, Quebec, Canada jaouhar.fattahi.1@ulaval.ca
? Dr. Nitul Dutta
Marwadi University, India nituldutta@ieee.org
? Dr. Mariam Ibrahim
German-Jordan University, Amman, Jordan mariam.wajdi@gju.edu.jo


Specialists in the security of industrial control systems and cybersecurity or related and relevant fields are invited to submit a chapter proposal before 31st December 2018. 
The detailed call for chapters is available on-line - https://iwsss.org/ICSS_CfC.pdf.
