IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing (TETC)
Special Issue/Section, First Issue of 2020

The Internet has revolutionized globalized society and enabled the growth of infrastructures, applications, and technologies that significantly enhance global interactions and collaborations that have significant impact on society. Unprecedented cyber-social, and cyber-physical infrastructures and systems that span geographic boundaries are possible because of the Internet and the growing number of collaboration enabling technologies. Individuals and organizations have increasingly relied on electronic and/or Internet-enabled collaboration between distributed teams of humans, computer applications, and/or autonomous robots to achieve higher productivity and produce collaboratively developed products that would have been impossible to develop without the contributions of multiple collaborators. IEEE TETC seeks original manuscripts for a Special Issue/Section on Emerging Trends and Design Paradigms for Collaboration and Internet Computing, covering the entire spectrum of relevant research activities from Internet-scale collaborative networking and computing to approaches for collaboration, and novel applications. Specific topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
1. Emerging Internet-scale collaborative networking &amp; computing technologies and infrastructures: Cloud to fog/edge computing, data and service models, system engineering, metrics and performance, security, privacy and trust in collaborative computing, big data analytics for data-driven collaboration, social computing for collaboration, cognitive collaboration

2. Emerging Approaches to collaboration: Collaboration in pervasive and cloud computing environments, collaborative sensor networks,  collaborative search and question answering, human computation and crowdsourcing,  participatory sensing, crowdsourcing, and citizen science, collaborative technologies for cyber-physical-human environments

3. Emerging Applications such as collaboration in vehicular networks, smart cities, health networks, disaster/crisis management, and supply chain management.

Submitted articles must not have been previously published or currently submitted for journal publication elsewhere. An extended version of the article appearing in any conference proceedings can be submitted provided that it has substantially new content w.r.t. to the original conference version. The conference paper must be cited in the main text and the cover letter must clearly describe the differences with the conference version and clearly identify the new contributions.
