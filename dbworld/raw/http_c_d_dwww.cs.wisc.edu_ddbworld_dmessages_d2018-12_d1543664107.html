SOFSEM (SOFtware SEMinar) is an annual international winter conference
devoted to the theory and practice of computer science. SOFSEM presents
the latest results and developments in academic and industrial research in
leading areas of Computer Science. The first SOFSEM was organized in 1974,
and it was traditionally located in the Czech and Slovak Republics, before it
starting moving to other European locations. In 2017 it was organised in
Ireland, in 2018 in Austria and in 2019 in Slovakia. The 46th edition will be
organised in the sunny Mediterranean island of Cyprus.

SOFSEM consists of Invited Talks by prominent researchers, Contributed
Talks selected from the submitted papers, and the Student Research Forum.
The program is organized in plenary talks and parallel tracks devoted to
original research in contemporary areas of Computer Science. SOFSEM has a
long-standing tradition of facilitating discussions and collegial interactions
and is well-known for its familiar and inspiring atmosphere and as a meeting
place for active and leading computer scientists.

SOFSEM is a track based conference. It features the traditional track on
Foundations of Computer Science and a number of other tracks that over the
years have evolved to cover and address contemporary important areas of
Computer Science, such as Artificial Intelligence, Cryptography, Security, and
Verification, Data Science, Knowledge Engineering, Social Computing and
Human Factors, Software and Web Engineering, etc.

The proceedings of SOFSEM are published in the prestigious ARCoSS
(Advanced Research in Computing and Software Science) subseries of
Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.

For SOFSEM 2020, the Steering Committee is inviting proposals for
organising tracks. The tracks can be of theoretical or practical nature or a
combination of both. Tracks from industry are particularly welcome. The
proposal should not exceed 3 pages and should include the following items:

a) Title, aim and scope of the proposed track, as well as the list of topics
that the proposed track will address.

b) Rationale for having this track in SOFSEM, including any other similar
events that the proposed track complements or differs from.

c) Names, affiliations and short CVs for the chairs of the proposed track,
demonstrating past relevant experience in organising such tracks or events.

d) Tentative list of names of the Program Committee for the proposed track.

e) A short dissemination plan for the CFP mentioning the forums where the
latter will be posted.

The proposals will be reviewed by the Steering Committee and the General
Chairs, based on the above mentioned criteria. A proposal may be accepted
as is, requested to modify its title and/or topics covered, merged with
another proposed track or rejected. Upon acceptance, the track chairs will
be notified of their exact duties in managing the affairs of their track. The
Steering Committee reserves the right to cancel a track at any moment in
time, if these responsibilities are not dealt with satisfactorily by the track
chairs.

Proposals should be submitted by February 11th, 2019 to the SOFSEM 2020
General Chairs, Yannis Manolopoulos (yannis.manolopoulos AT ouc.ac.cy)
and George A. Papadopoulos (george AT cs.ucy.ac.cy).
