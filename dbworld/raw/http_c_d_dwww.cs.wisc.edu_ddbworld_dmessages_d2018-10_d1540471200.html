*** Call for papers ***

The International Conference on Conceptual Modeling (ER) is the leading international forum for presenting and discussing current research on conceptual modeling. The topics of interest span the entire spectrum of conceptual modeling including research and practice in areas such: theories of concepts underlying conceptual modeling, methods and tools for developing and communicating conceptual models, techniques for transforming conceptual models into effective implementations, and the impact of conceptual modeling techniques on databases, business strategies and information systems development.

*** Target audiences and the scope ***

We solicit submission of original research, as well as experience and vision papers, from both researchers and practitioners, welcoming any topic where conceptual modeling is a major theme. We specifically encourage submissions on the application and role of conceptual modeling techniques in new and emerging areas such as large data repositories for business intelligence, cloud computing and NoSQL databases.

*** Specific examples of topics of interest include, but are not limited to, conceptual modeling as applied to:

Foundations and Concept Formalization
Domain Specific Conceptual Modeling Languages, Methods and Frameworks
Methodologies and Tools for Conceptual Design
Data Warehousing, Data Mining, Business Intelligence and Analytics
NoSQL and NewSQL Databases
