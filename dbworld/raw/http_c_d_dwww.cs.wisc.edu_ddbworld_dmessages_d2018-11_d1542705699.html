************************************************************************

====IMPORTANT DATES====

- November 30, 2018: Full paper submission
- January 25, 2019: Notification of acceptance
- February 15, 2019: Camera-ready copy due

====BACKGROUND====

Recent advances in developments of wireless Internet technologies have generated increasing interest in the diffusion and processing of large volumes of geo-spatial data. Spatially enabled mobile devices also offer new ways of accessing and analyzing this geo-referenced information. Consequently, new challenges and opportunities have appeared in the GIS research community. This symposium provides an up-to-date review of advances in both theoretical and technical development of Web and wireless geographical information systems (W2GIS). It is the 17th in a series of successful events beginning in 2001, and alternating locations annually between East Asia and Europe with the most recent Symposium held in A Coruna, Spain.

====TOPICS====

We invite submissions that address theoretical, technical, and practical issues of W2GIS and location-based services. Reports of on-going implementations are particularly welcome. Suggested topics include, but are not limited to:

- Geospatial databases and spatio-temporal data management
- Mobile spatial interaction
- Spatial search, GeoWeb search engines and services
- Spatially embedded social networks and the Web
- On-line spatial data mining
- GeoSensor data acquisition, processing, management and analysis
- Smart environments, Internet of Things and ambient spatial intelligence
- Exploratory cartography and Web and wireless geo interfaces
- Advanced GIS visualization techniques for Web and mobile applications
- Cyber-geography &amp; augmented reality
- Map personalization and adaptation
- 3D modelling of cityscapes for location-based services
- Location-based service applications in both real-world and virtual spaces
- Ubiquitous and wireless GIS
- Security, privacy, and usability issues of Web and wireless environments
- Semantic geospatial Web and interoperability
- Telematics and GIS applications
- User studies and evaluations of online geo services
- Indoor and outdoor wayfinding and navigation
- Volunteered Geographic Information and crowdsourcing on the Web

====PAPER SUBMISSION====

Authors are invited to submit full, original, unpublished research papers. Each paper must be written in English, should be submitted in PDF, and formatted using the Springer camera-ready templates available at:
<a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs">http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs</a>.

Submissions are welcome in three different streams: full papers up to 16 pages, industrial papers, work in progress and showcases up to 8 pages. Papers should be uploaded through the submission site at: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=w2gis19

All submissions will be refereed for quality, originality, and relevance by the Program Committee. Accepted papers will be published in the Springer LNCS series. A selection of best papers will be considered for a special issue of a journal publication.

Acceptance of a paper means an obligation for at least one of the authors to attend the conference and present the paper. Otherwise, the accepted submission will not appear in the published proceedings.
