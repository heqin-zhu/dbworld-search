  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Department of Computer Science in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) invites applications for tenure-track assistant professor or tenured associate/full professor positions beginning July 1, 2019. The Department is interested in individuals with research interests in computer systems (broadly defined) including, but not limited to, topics such as: databases, Big Data, cloud computing, distributed and parallel systems, operating systems, storage systems, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and programming languages.

The UCI database group (consisting of Mike Carey, Chen Li, and Sharad Mehrotra) is looking to grow this year. We are particularly interested in applicants at the assistant professor level. Overall, the UCI Computer Science Department's curricula, faculty and research focus on an array of topics including: computer architecture, embedded systems, system software, networking and distributed computing, data and information systems, artificial intelligence, and computer graphics; while also exploring interdisciplinary topics such as biomedical informatics, data mining, security and privacy, and ubiquitous computing.

At UCI, ICS brings together three unique departments (Computer Science, Informatics, and Statistics), thus strategically positioning itself to meet the technical and social challenges of computing and information systems in the coming decades. The U.S. News and World Report 2018 ranking identifies UCI as one of the top 30 universities for computer science in the United States. ICS is one of only five computing-focused schools among the Association of American Universities (AAU) members. The 90+ ICS school faculty members include 2 NAE Members, 14 ACM Fellows, 9 IEEE Fellows, 9 AAAS Fellows, and many other national award winners.
