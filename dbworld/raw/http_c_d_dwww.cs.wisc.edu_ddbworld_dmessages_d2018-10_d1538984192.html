DEEP LEARNING and NEURAL SYSTEMS in Robotics
https://www.degruyter.com/page/1695

Topical Issue in 
PALADYN. Journal of Behavioral Robotics 
<a href="http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/pjbr">http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/pjbr</a>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION
===============
Deep Learning can equip robots with a new level of skill by utilizing insights from neuroscience.
These new developments have impact on various types of robots, from companion robots to driver assistance in semi-autonomous vehicles. Deep Learning can enable unprecedented quality of results in tasks such as object detection, localization, communication and behavior learning.
Training deep neural networks typically requires GPU workstations or high-performance computing servers. It may require huge amounts of data or innovative training schemes. These issues indicate only some of the special challenges when utilizing deep networks in robotics.

Within this context the topics of this thematic special issue include, but are not limited to:

  #  applications of deep learning
  #  software and hardware systems 
  #  data acquisition for deep learning
  #  neural information processing systems
  #  deep learning training schemes and paradigms 
  #  GPU computing for deep learning
  #  software engineering for deep learning
  #  neural networks on low powered devices
  #  human robot interaction and communication
  #  cognitive, developmental and evolutionary robotics

Authors are requested to submit their papers to the Topical Issue complying the general scope of the journal. The submitted papers will undergo the standard peer-review process before they can be accepted. Notification of acceptance will be communicated as we progress with the review process.
