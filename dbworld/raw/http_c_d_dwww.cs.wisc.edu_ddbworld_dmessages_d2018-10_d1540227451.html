Abstract:
Graph data modeling and querying arises in many practical application domains such as social and biological networks where the primary focus is on concepts and their relationships and the rich patterns in these complex webs of interconnectivity. In this book, we present a concise unified view on the basic challenges which arise over the complete life cycle of formulating and processing queries on graph databases. To that purpose, we present all major concepts relevant to this life cycle, formulated in terms of a common and unifying ground: the property graph data model (the pre-dominant data model adopted by modern graph database systems).

We aim especially to give a coherent and in-depth perspective on current graph querying and an outlook for future developments. Our presentation is self-contained, covering the relevant topics from: graph data models, graph query languages and graph query specification, graph constraints, and graph query processing. We conclude by indicating major open research challenges towards the next generation of graph data management systems.
