Future Networks and Communications (FNC) research effort will help achieving a major promise of the emerging technologies such as, ubiquitous access to broadband, supporting vital applications in our daily lives such as health, energy consumption, environment transport, entertainment or education. The scope of FNC is the development of energy-efficient future network infrastructures that support the convergence and interoperability of heterogeneous mobile, wired and wireless broadband network technologies as enablers of the future Internet. This includes but not limited to ubiquitous fast broadband access and ultra-high speed end-to-end optical connectivity, supporting open services and innovative ambient applications. Scope also embraces novel and evolutionary approaches to tackle network architectures, taking due consideration of users and societal needs for success.
