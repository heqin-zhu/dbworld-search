  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">PhD Positions in Computer Science, Engineering, Business and Law 
with a Focus on Future Energy Systems


The design of future energy systems which can cope with fluctuating supply and flexible demand is an important concern of our society. As a PhD student in computer science, economics or law, would you like the opportunity to not only have results that advance the state-of-the-art in your field and have good publications at selective venues, but also seriously engage in interactions with other disciplines, to ensure that your results really give way to better energy systems? As a PhD student in engineering, would you like to not only work on the design of energy systems that are efficient, flexi-ble, resilient and user-friendly, but also do so together with individuals from the above disciplines, using highly innovative methods? 

If so, please read on: The German National Research Foundation (DFG) funds the research-training group 'Energy Status Data ? Informatics Methods for its Collection, Analysis, and Exploitation' at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). We now seek to fill several vacancies for PhD students starting in the first half of 2019. Important prerequisites are interest in scientific work and a Master or Diploma degree in one of the above disciplines or in a related one, e.g., mathematics, physics, busi-ness informatics, industrial engineering and management. Successful candidates should demon-strate academic excellence and rigor as well as curiosity. See <a href="http://energystatusdata.kit.edu">http://energystatusdata.kit.edu</a> for more information on the research envisioned, the program and the application procedure. Please apply until January 27th 2019. 

We offer:

?	a lot of free space for scientific development,
?	excellent personal guidance and support, 
?	fascinating research topics with a lot of societal relevance,
?	an open-minded and highly collaborative research environment
?	an international, interdisciplinary research surrounding with numerous occasions for co-operation,
?	opportunities for personal growth and further training leveraging the rich infrastructure at KIT, an institution that is both a university and a large-scale research facility,
?	an excellent living environment in an attractive, vibrant city in one of the most beautiful regions in Germany,
?	a salary that covers the living expenses in Germany well, together with free university registration.


Both DFG and KIT are pursuing a gender equality policy. We would therefore particularly encourage qualified women to apply. If qualified, handicapped applicants will be preferred.

Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) is a public corporation pursuing the tasks of a State Universi-ty of Baden-Wuerttemberg and of a national research center of the Helmholtz Association. The KIT mission combines the three strategic lines of activity of research, higher education, and innovation.
