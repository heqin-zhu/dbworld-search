Service-Oriented Computing exploits services as the fundamental elements of computer-based systems. It has been applied to various areas and promotes fundamental changes to the way software systems are being analyzed, architected, designed, implemented, tested, evaluated, delivered, consumed, maintained and evolved.&nbsp;Starting from 2005, SOSE is a pioneering IEEE sponsored international conference devoted to the research in engineering service-oriented systems. It covers all aspects of service-oriented engineering from architectures, techniques, tools and languages to methodologies. SOSE 2019 invites original submissions in all the areas of the system engineering and software engineering methods, techniques, tools, applications, and experiments for software services.
