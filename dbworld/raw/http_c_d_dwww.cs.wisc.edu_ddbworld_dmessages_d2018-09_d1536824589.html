CALL FOR PAPERS
---------------

2nd International Workshop on Uncertainty in Cloud Computing (UCC 2018)
<a href="http://sites.google.com/site/ucc18workshop/">http://sites.google.com/site/ucc18workshop/</a>

Held in parallel with
10th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science (CloudCom 2018).
Nicosia, Cyprus
December 10, 2018

---------------------------------

With the goal to introduce participants to the concept of ?Uncertain Cloud?, UCC 2018 is an opportunity for researchers to publish their original research works that deal with uncertainty issues in various cloud computing topics.

AIMS AND SCOPE:
Cloud computing is an emerging technology that offers various services on demand. The correct characterization and management of Cloud environment objects (clouds, data centers, providers, services, data, users, etc.) is the first step towards effective provisioning and integration of cloud services. However, Cloud computing environment is often subject to uncertainty. This could be attributed to the incompleteness and imprecision of Cloud available information, as well as the highly dynamic environment.
Cloud services are associated with some uncertainty in their information, including QoS levels, users rating, available resources, workload and performance changes, dynamic elasticity, availability zones, service descriptions, etc. Also, the highly dynamic cloud environment adds a new factor of uncertainty, as it may have a negative impact on the quality of cloud services and, consequently, on services provisioning and integration. This uncertainty regarding the cloud services context raises a question about how to trust the available cloud information and brings additional challenges to the cloud actors. Therefore, the need to handle uncertainty in the context of cloud environments is of paramount importance to maintain the sustainable use of such technology.
Extensive research has been conducted to address uncertainty issues in various fields including computational biology, e-commerce, social networks, decision making, data integration, location-based services, and recently Internet of Things. However, uncertainty issues in the context of Cloud computing have not been solved yet. A main motivation behind addressing uncertainty in the cloud, to satisfy user needs, is the growing reliance on such highly dynamic cross-platform also considered as a big distributed container of uncertain Cloud services and their related data.

TOPICS OF INTEREST:
By organizing this workshop, we aim to collect recent and significant solutions in the area of uncertain Cloud. We look for original and high quality submissions related to (but not limited to) the following topics:
Uncertainty models for Clouds, services and users.
Techniques and methods for uncertainty assessment in Cloud computing.
Cloud service provisioning and composition under uncertainty.
Service retrieval and discovery of Cloud availability zones under uncertainty.
Data quality in uncertain Cloud.
Uncertain data integration and Database-as-a-Service.
Uncertain databases and multi-databases in the uncertain cloud.
Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery in uncertain cloud.
Reasoning over uncertain cloud services.
Reputation and trust management of cloud services under uncertainty.
Uncertainty and data provenance in multi-cloud environments.
Bayesian and probabilistic models and their relevance to the uncertain cloud.
Specifying and controlling uncertain cloud services elasticity.
Uncertainty and fuzziness in multi-cloud environments.
Uncertainty-aware resource provisioning in the multi-cloud.
Formal and fuzzy methods and theoretical algorithms for uncertain Cloud.
Service and data placement approaches under uncertainty.
Security and privacy in uncertain Clouds.
