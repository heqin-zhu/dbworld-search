23rd INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATABASE THEORY (ICDT 2020) 

Copenhagen, Denmark, March 30 - April 2, 2020

* About ICDT 

ICDT is an international conferences series that addresses the
principles and theory of data management. Since 2009, it is annually
and jointly held with EDBT, the international conference on extending
database technology. See also https://databasetheory.org/icdt-pages.

* Broadening Scope

As ICDT strives to broaden its scope, ICDT 2020 will have a Reach Out
Track that calls for

- novel formal frameworks or directions for database theory and/or
- connections between principles of data management and other   
  communities.

The aim of the Reach Out track is to present novel and important
directions for database theory and to expand the scope and impact of
ICDT towards neighboring communities such as Database Systems,
Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Representation, Machine Learning,
Programming Languages, Distributed Computing, and Operating Systems.
It is reasonable for articles submitted to this track to be be shorter
than regular ICDT submissions. Submissions will be judged mainly in
terms of their potential to lead to valuable and impactful theoretical
developments. We encourage authors to illustrate the potential impact
via convincing examples, preliminary results, and clearly specified
open problems.

* Topics of Interest

Every topic related to the principles of data management is relevant 
to ICDT. Particularly welcome are contributions that connect data 
management to theoretical computer science, and those that connect
database theory and database practice. 

Examples of relevant topics include:
- Data mining, information extraction, information retrieval, and   
  database aspects of machine learning
- Data models, design, structures, semantics, query languages, 
  and algorithms for data management
- Distributed and parallel databases, cloud computing
- Databases and knowledge representation
- Graph databases, (semantic) Web data, and Web services
- Data streams and sketching
- Data-centric (business) process management and workflows
- Data and knowledge integration and exchange, data provenance, views, 
  and data warehouses
- Domain-specific databases (multimedia, scientific, spatial, etc)
- Data privacy and security, concurrency, and recovery

* Submission Cycles and Dates 

ICDT has two submission cycles, the first providing the possibility 
of a revision. 

First cycle abstract deadline: March 27, 2019
Full paper submission deadline: April 3, 2019
Notification: May 29, 2019

Second cycle abstract deadline: September 15, 2019

* Submission Instructions

Submissions will be electronic via EasyChair at
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icdt2020.

Papers must be written in English and provide sufficient detail to allow 
the program committee to assess their merits. The results must be 
unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere, including
the proceedings of other symposia, workshops, and journals.

Papers must be submitted as a PDF document and use the LIPIcs style
(<a href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors">http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors</a>).
Paper length is limited to 15 pages excluding references, both for
regular submissions and for the Reach Out Track. Additional details
may be included in a clearly marked appendix which will be read at the
discretion of the program committee. Online appendices are not
allowed. Papers that do not conform to these requirements may be
rejected without further consideration.

The proceedings will appear in the Leibniz International Proceedings
in Informatics (LIPIcs) series, based at Schloss Dagstuhl. This
guarantees that the proceedings will be available under the gold open
access model, that is, online and free of charge while the authors
retain the rights over their work.

At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register at
the conference and to present the paper.

* Awards

An award will be given to the Best Paper and to the Best Newcomer
Paper where `newcomer' refers to the field of database theory. The
latter award will preferentially be given to a paper authored only by
students and in that case be called Best Student-Paper Award. The
program committee reserves the right to not give any award and to
split an award among several papers. Papers co-authored by program
committee members are not eligible for an award.
