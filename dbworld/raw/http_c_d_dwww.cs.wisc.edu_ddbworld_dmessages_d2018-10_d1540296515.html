--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Paper submission deadline extended until November 5, 2018.

* We solicit more short papers than in the past to stimulate more vivid discussion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* The best DOLAP 2019 papers will be invited for submission to the 
  Information Systems journal (Elsevier)

* Invited talk will be given by Prof. Norman Paton (details will be 
  provided asap) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data Warehouse (DW) and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) technologies are the core 
of current Decision Support Systems. The widespread deployment of both DWs and OLAP 
technologies is due to the intuitive representation of data and simple primitives 
provided to data analysts or managers in support of management decisions. Research in
data warehousing and OLAP has produced important technologies for the design,
management, and use of information systems for decision support. 

Business Intelligence (BI) of the future will be significantly different than what the 
current state-of-the-practice supports. The trend is to move from the current decision 
support systems that are "data presenting" to more dynamic systems that allow the semi-
automation of the decision making process. This means that the systems partially guide 
their users towards data discovery, intuition, and system-aided decision making via 
intelligent techniques and visualization. In the back stage, the thrust of the big data 
era, with the requires that new methods, models, techniques, or architecture are needed 
to cope with the increasing demand in capacity, data type diversity, and responsiveness. 
And of course, this does not necessarily mean to re-invent the wheel, but rather, as 
recommended by Gartner to companies regarding BD adoption, "Build on existing BI 
programs - don't abandon or segregate them". We envision DOLAP 2018 as a venue where 
novel ideas around these new landscapes of business intelligence and big data are 
fostered and nurtured and new exciting results are produced, in an attempt to build a 
strong, vibrant community around these areas.

  stream and sensor data, semantic Web &amp; deep Web in data warehouses, data lakes, 
  data quality, graph data management

Optimization
* Coping with Volume: physical organization of data warehouses, performance 
  optimization and tuning, scalability of DW, MapReduce in data warehouses, 
  performance optimization of ETL/ELT
* Coping with Velocity: DW deployment on parallel machine, database clusters, cloud
  infrastructures for DW, smart grid, active/real-time analytics &amp; data warehouses, 
  real-time queries

Analytical Processing and applications
* Analytics and Value: OLAP exploration through visualization, recommendation, 
  reformulation, approximate query-answering, personalization, result presentation, 
  data storytelling, graph analytics, process mining, advanced visualization for 
  business contexts
* Analytics and Veracity: heterogeneous data integration for analtyics, quality aspects 
  of OLAP analysis, exploration outcome and end-user experience, fairness of data 
  analysis, analytics and data driven decision making for the data enthusiasts
* Integration of analytics with machine learning, data mining, information retrieval, 
  search engines, predictive and prescriptive analytics
* Big Data applications: smart city, smart health, smart energy, etc.
