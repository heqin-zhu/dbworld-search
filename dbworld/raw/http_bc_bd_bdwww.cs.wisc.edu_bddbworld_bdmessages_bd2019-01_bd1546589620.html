CfP: Workshop on Fog Computing and the Internet of Things (Fog-IoT 2019), co-located with CPS-IoT Week 2019
https://sites.google.com/iotcenter.dk/fog-iot

When cyber-physical systems become interconnected with each other and with the Internet, they are called the Internet of Things (IoT), forming "the infrastructure of the information society". Fog Computing is a "system-level architecture that distributes resources and services of computing, storage, control and net-working anywhere along the continuum from Cloud to Things"  and is about to tremendously impact the IoT. The Fog-IoT 2019 workshop will be co-located with CPS-IoT Week 2019, taking place in Montreal, Canada, April 15-18, 2019. The workshop itself takes place on April 15th.

###TOPICS OF INTEREST###
The objective of this workshop is to be a forum for presenting and discussing recent developments and trends in Fog/Edge Computing that represent challenges and opportunities for CPS and IoT researchers and practitioners. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
* Fog Computing Architectures and Frameworks
* Virtualization and Hypervisors for Fog Computing 
* Middleware for Fog Computing
* Real-Time and Schedulability Aspects of Fog Computing
* Formal Methods for Fog Computing Systems
* CPS and Fog Computing
* Multi-tiered, novel Resource Management Solutions Involving the Edge/Fog/Cloud
* Software-Defined Solutions in Fog Computing
* Mobile Fog Computing
* Data Centers and Infrastructures for Fog Computing
* Programming Models and Runtime Systems for Fog Computing
* Fog Resource Management for Guaranteed Quality-of-Service
* Control-as-a-service and Virtualization of Control, Guaranteeing Quality-of-Control
* Fog Computing Modeling and Analysis
* Performance Analysis of Fog Computing Systems 
* Fog and Cloud Integration
* Data Analytics and AI/ML at the Edge
* Use Cases for / and Applications of Fog Computing
* Emerging Fog Communication Technologies and Protocols (IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking, 5G)
* Fog Computing Security, Data Privacy and Trust
* Fog Computing Dependability and Safety
* Standardization Efforts and Standards Relevant for Fog Computing
* Interoperability Standards and Solutions, including OPC UA and DDS
* Discussion of Open Datasets and Testbeds

###SUBMISSION###
The material must be unpublished and not under submission elsewhere. Submissions will be accepted based on their originality, quality, significance, and relevance. Position papers and review papers are welcome, as long as they contain original material. The papers will be published in IEEE Xplore, unless the authors notify the organizers that they prefer not to include their paper in IEEE Xplore. The paper PDF will be linked in the program website, but it will not be considered a formal publication. Please submit your paper via the submission page https://sites.google.com/iotcenter.dk/fog-iot/submission

By submitting a paper, the authors confirm that if the paper is accepted, at least one author will register for the workshop by the  registration deadline set in the notification of acceptance, and present the paper at the workshop in person. Extended versions of the accepted papers may be invited to special issues in a journal.

The main body of each submitted paper is limited to 4 pages of technical content with additional pages permitted for the bibliography and acknowledgments only (i.e., references and acknowledgements do not count against the page limit).  Submissions must be formatted according to IEEE conference paper guidelines (10pt font, default margins, default line spacing). Please use one of the available IEEE conference templates https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html.

###IMPORTANT DATES###
* Paper Submission: January 15, 2019 (firm)
* Author Notification: February 11, 2019
* Camera-Ready Paper: February 15, 2019

###CO-CHAIRS###
* Paul Pop, Technical University of Denmark
* Karl-Erik Arzen, Lund University, Sweden
