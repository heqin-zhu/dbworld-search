The International Conference on Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering is the premier conference concerned with the foundations on which software engineering is built. It is one of the five main European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS) taking place in April 2019 in Prague. We welcome innovative contributions making software engineering a more mature discipline based on well-founded principles.

Submission Guidelines

FASE accepts 3 types of submissions: research papers, regular tool papers and tool demo papers.

- Research papers clearly identify and justify a principled advance to the fundamentals of software engineering. Papers should clearly articulate their contribution, and provide sufficient evidence for the validity and applicability of the proposed approach. Research papers that combine the development of conceptual and methodological advances with their formal foundations and tool support are particularly encouraged. Research papers can have a maximum of 15 pp (excluding the bibliography).
- Regular tool papers present a new tool, a new tool component, or novel extensions to an existing tool. They should provide a short description of the theoretical foundations with relevant citations, and emphasize the design and implementation concerns, including software architecture. A regular tool paper should give a clear account of the tool's functionality, discuss the tool's practical capabilities with reference to the type and size of problems it can handle, describe experience with realistic case studies, and where applicable, provide a rigorous experimental evaluation. Papers that present extensions to existing tools should clearly focus on the improvements or extensions with respect to previously published versions of the tool, preferably substantiated by data on enhancements in terms of resources and capabilities. Authors are strongly encouraged to make their tools publicly available (in the final version of an accepted paper), preferably on the web; links to tool repositories or other supplementary material may be hidden in the submitted version of a paper, if these links would otherwise endanger the anonymity of the authors. But no extra efforts are expected to disguise the identity of a tool (e.g., renaming the presented tool, moving the tool to another repository). Just reference the tool in your submission in a way that leaves it open whether the submitted tool (or extension, demonstration, etc.) paper has been submitted by the original developers of the tool or a new group of developers or users (if possible). Regular tool papers can have a maximum of 15 pp (excluding the bibliography).
- Tool demonstration papers focus on the usage aspects of tools. As with regular tool papers, authors are strongly encouraged to make their tools publicly available, preferably on the web. Theoretical foundations and experimental evaluation are not required, however, a motivation as to why the tool is interesting and significant should be provided. Tool demonstration papers can have a maximum of 6 pp (including bibliography). They should have an appendix of up to 6 additional pages with details on the actual demonstration.

List of Topics
 
Contributions that combine the development of conceptual and methodological advances with their formal foundations and tool support are particularly encouraged. We invite contributions on all such fundamental approaches, including:

- Software engineering as an engineering discipline, including its interaction with and impact on society and economics;
- Requirements engineering: capture, consistency, and change management of software requirements;
- Software architectures: description and analysis of the architecture of individual systems or classes of applications;
- Specification, design, and implementation of particular classes of systems: (self-)adaptive, collaborative, embedded, distributed, mobile, pervasive, cyber-physical or service-oriented applications;
- Software quality: (static or run-time) validation and verification of functional and non-functional software properties using theorem proving, model checking, testing, analysis, simulation, refinement methods, metrics or visualization techniques;
- Model-driven development and model transformation: meta-modeling, design and semantics of domain-specific languages, consistency and transformation of models, generative architectures;
- Software processes: support for iterative, agile, and open source development;
- Software evolution: refactoring, reverse and re-engineering, configuration management and architectural change, or aspect-orientation.
