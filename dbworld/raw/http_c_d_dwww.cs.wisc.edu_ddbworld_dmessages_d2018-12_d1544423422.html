Workshop Objective
----------------------------
Following up the success of the past events at WWW2015, WWW2016, WWW2017 and WWW2018, the 5th AW4City 2019 aims to keep on attracting a significant international attention with regard to web applications for smart cities. 

This year, AW4City emphasizes on the contribution of web applications and Apps to urban mobility. In the era of cities and under the UN 2030 Agenda for sustainable growth, cities are making an important shift regarding thinking of compact cities and they develop sustainable mobility plans. Issues like parking, traffic congestion and safety, sharing transportation and smart parking are among the topics where governments and the industry direct smart services, while data collection and analysis enable government?s fast ?or even real-time- decision-making for alternative transportation means? deliberation, public transportation changes, urban planning etc., and new business models appear that utilize platforms and data. Additionally, new types of business in transportation appear (e.g., that utilize sensors and big data), while things? transportation is another challenge that cities have been started phasing. ?his workshop aims to demonstrate how web applications and Apps can enhance transportation services and urban mobility in general.

The aim of this workshop is to address web-based application and Apps? design and development in the smart city and urban context.  More specifically, it focuses on innovative applications smart city component and more specifically on the design and implementation of web-based applications and Apps. This component is crucial, since it addresses all the smart city dimensions:
?	Economy, since new types of entrepreneurship and innovative business models appear in data, creative and climate economies, and develop web applications and Apps. 
?	Mobility, with regard to urban transportation (intelligent transportation), distance working, job offering demonstration etc.
?	Environment, since applications enhance resource management, transportation improvement, environmental monitoring etc.
?	Living, since applications enhance local life (i.e., e-learning, e-banking, e-commerce, e-tourism etc.). 
?	People, since they concern applications? end users and
?	Governance, where open data and e-government applications play crucial roles in smart city operation.


Theoretical concepts, empirical evidence and selected case studies from leading scholars and practitioners in the field showing the ?big picture? of smart cities and urban areas will be examined in this workshop. 

This workshop aims at gathering researchers from the fields of smart cities and web application development to think about the obstacles that hurdle the leveraging of understanding and capturing of smart city trends with regard web application development that interconnect citizens, businesses and government in a smart city.

AW4City 2019 is timely since sustainable transportation has been addressed as one of the UN Agenda 2030 strategic goals, while ISO37120 and ISO37122 that certify city services focus on smart and sustainable transportation too. Last but not least, customer satisfaction is being measured real-time, while corresponding safety can be ensured with the use of platforms (e.g., Uber and Lyft). All these issues are being supported by data, the Web and Apps and it is important to focus on future achievements.

Additionally, an increasing criticism is that smart city represents an ambiguous urban utopia, which is supported by the partnership of local governments with big technological vendors. Articles can deliver a clearer view of smart city reality, while innovative applications can strengthen the existence of opportunities for new entrants in the smart city market. Moreover, most standardization bodies evolve competitive standards for smart city components and to this end, this workshop is expected to highlight existing development and trends with regard to application development (web-based, apps and end-to-end).

We target researchers from both industry and academia to join forces in this exciting area. We intend to discuss the recent and significant developments in the general areas of smart cities and web applications and to promote cross-fertilization of techniques. In particular, we aim at identifying trends and respective applications in smart cities; the potential impact of smart city in web applications; techniques from end-to-end solutions? or apps? development that will enable researchers to understand the dynamic phenomena in smart cities, as well as specify important directions for the research communities. Standards for web applications? development in smart cities is interesting for several areas such as sustainability, crisis management, marketing, security, and interoperability. To address the above mentioned aspects, we solicit the following topics (but not limited to):

?	Enhancing mobility experience with Web Applications and Apps;
?	Apps that support mobility, sharing, crowd-sourcing etc.;
?	Smart City management systems with emphasis on mobility (e.g. parking; traffic etc.);
?	Mobility Practices of Web applications and Apps in smart cities;
?	Theoretical foundations on Smart City applications and standards;
?	Creative partnerships, creative industries and industry 4.0 in Smart City with a focus on application development (Internet Economics and Monetization);
?	Pervasive Web and Mobility for Smart City emerging topics (i.e., user behavior analytics, energy, water, waste, transportation etc.)
?	The role of mobility partners for smart city applications development and standardization (i.e., promotion push, start-ups, open data);
?	Web Infrastructure standardization;
?	The role of standards on smart city data mining; 
?	Smart city mobility e-services;
?	Smart city information quality and evolution in social content;
?	Ensuring mobility security and privacy in Smart Cities: the role of web applications and Apps.


Submission
-------------------------------------
We welcome full research papers, research in progress, and discussion papers. Full papers should be up to 10 pages long, including the abstract and appendices.

Discussion papers may be short (up to 6 pages), but should clearly and distinctly address one or more issues pertinent to Smart City research including research methods and quality as well as focus of studies. Papers should be designed to support in-depth discussions of one of these issues during the workshop.?Although it is a half-day event, the workshop papers will be clustered and each session will discuss a small set of papers focusing on similar or related issues.

Accepted refereed papers, must be presented at the conference by an author who is registered to attend. Please be aware that the WWW 2019 organizers will require at least one registration per paper published in either the main Proceedings or in the Companion volume. At the time of submission of the final camera-ready copy, authors will have to indicate the already registered person for that publication. We strongly encourage at least one author of every paper to register by the early-bird deadline so that session chairs can make plans for its presentation. 

Please submit your papers via the Easychair (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aw4city2019)?or via e-mail (in .doc/docx and .pdf format) to: lanthopo@teilar.gr? with the subject: ?AW4city 2019 proposal?
Details of the programme will be made available online.
