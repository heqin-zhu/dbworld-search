  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Assistant/Adjunct/Full Professor in Distributed Systems (1.0 FTE)
Vacancy number 218412

Organisation
The vacancy concerns an assistant/adjunct/full professor in Distributed Systems at the Bernoulli Institute for Mathematics, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (BI) of the Faculty of Science and Engineering (FSE). The BI comprises five mathematics programmes, six computer science programmes and four artificial intelligence programmes. The research of the Computer Science department of the institute centers around fundamental computing, software engineering, information and distributed systems, visual computing, and intelligent systems, keeping a balanced mix of fundamental and applied aspects. The position will be embedded in the basic unit Distributed Systems. The institute participates in the FSE research theme Data Science and Systems Complexity (DSSC) and the new Center on Cognitive Systems and Materials (CogniGron).
Job description
The candidate is expected to develop an internationally leading research track record in Distributed Systems, leading to an autonomous research programme within the institute. The concepts of distributed systems are widely adopted in a modern world - you rarely see an application that is not distributed or not communicating across network. However, our knowledge on how to build such systems is still limited: the majority of such systems (while being distributed) are still controlled in a centralized fashion and put strict requirements on the consistency and availability of data, the location of processing nodes, the network latencies, etc. Distributed and parallel algorithms in the areas of discrete and hybrid optimization, AI planning, or constraint satisfaction are of particular interest for this position. Additional domains of interest are Internet-of-Things and pervasive computing; blockchain, smart contracts and their applications; Big Data processing; SOA and cloud computing; energy and water management.
The research should lead to publications in high impact scientific journals and to contributions to major conferences in the field of expertise. Supervision of PhD students and postdocs is an important part of the research activities. Obtaining substantial external funding for PhD and postdoc projects is crucial. A strong involvement in the research theme Data Science and Systems Complexity (DSSC) is expected. We also foresee collaboration with the Center for Cognitive Systems and Materials. New developments in the field of cognitive/neuromorphic computing would require new distributed algorithms and computer architectures that will significantly influence the research being performed in the area of distributed systems. Interaction with other domains that require support from distributed systems (e.g., astronomy, biology, medicine, data analytics companies, big data, smart energy systems), or provide relevant complementary expertise (mathematics, artificial intelligence) is very important.
The successful candidate is expected to contribute to the teaching within the bachelor and master programmes of Computer Science in the Undergraduate and Graduate Schools of Science of the FSE. He/she will contribute both to teaching existing courses, and to the development of new courses in distributed systems. The candidate is expected to have an active interest and to provide a positive contribution to the management and organizational tasks of the institute. At the level of the FSE, the candidate will contribute to the organization of the faculty, for example by participating in working groups and committees, in the fields of teaching, research and management. The candidate will participate in relevant national and international organizations.
Qualifications
You have:
? a PhD degree in the field of Computer Science or related discipline
? a minimum of two years postdoctoral experience abroad, divided over no more than 2 episodes (industrial experience can partially compensate for this requirement)
? excellent research qualities, as evidenced by a publication record in international peer-reviewed journals and renowned conferences, and a relevant international network
? teaching and organizational experience appropriate to career stage
? evidence of successful acquisition of external funding appropriate to career stage.
You are:
? a team player with good communications skills
? willing to fulfill the requirements for the University Teaching Qualification
? willing to learn the Dutch language.
Conditions of employment
For tenure tracker:
The appointment will be initially for a maximum of 7 years at the level of tenure track assistant professor with a gross monthly salary dependent on qualifications and work experience from ? 3,545 up to a maximum of ? 5,513 (CAO-NU salary scales 11 or 12) for a full-time position. The successful candidate will participate in the career track of the Faculty of Science and Engineering known as Career Paths in Science. After 5 years there will be an assessment of performance based on established criteria. If the outcome of the assessment is positive, the assistant professor will be promoted to associate professor with tenure. There will be another assessment at the end of a further 4-7 -year period for the promotion to full professor.
For associate/full professor:
The appointment of Associate Professor will be a tenured appointment. The gross monthly salary, dependent on qualifications and work experience, will be from ? 4,911 up to a maximum of ? 6,567 (CAO NU salary scales 13/14, 2016) gross per month for a full-time position. The successful candidate will participate in the career track of the Faculty of Science and Engineering known as Career Paths in Science. There will be an assessment at the end of a 4-7 -years period for the promotion to full professor.
The appointment of Full Professor will be a tenured appointment. The gross monthly salary, dependent on qualifications and work experience, will be from ? 5,441 up to a maximum of ? 7,921 (CAO-NU salary scales H2) for a full-time position.
Additional benefits for tenure trackers and associate/full professors:
In addition to the primary salary the University offers 8% holiday allowance and an end-of-year bonus of 8,3%.
The University of Groningen provides career services for partners of new faculty members moving to Groningen.
The University of Groningen has adopted an active policy to increase the number of female scientists across all disciplines of the university. Therefore, female candidates are especially encouraged to apply.
