Lecturers should have the ability to teach in multiple areas across the curriculum, including data structures and algorithms, programming languages, software security and information assurance, web and mobile applications, and computer systems and networks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lecturers also contribute to the service mission of the programs through student outreach activities, serve on committees and in industry engagement activities in support of CIDSE. Faculty are also expected to remain engaged in professional development and external service.

A minimum of a M.S. in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Computer Engineering or a related discipline is required by time of the appointment. Preference will be given to those candidates with a Ph.D. or near completion of a Ph.D. by time of the appointment with proven teaching skills in undergraduate education in both full-immersion and digital immersion formats.
