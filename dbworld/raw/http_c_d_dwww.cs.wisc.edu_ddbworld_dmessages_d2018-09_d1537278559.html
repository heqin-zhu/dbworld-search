CIbSE is the leading research forum on Software Engineering (SE) in Ibero-America. The primary objective of this conference is to promote high-quality scientific research in Ibero-American countries and, thus, support the researchers in this community in publishing and discussing their work. Also, the conference fosters collaboration and cross-fertilization among academics, students, and practitioners from industry.


CIbSE 2019 will be held in Havana as well as Varadero, Cuba. The event will include various tracks, an industrial session, keynotes from influential researchers of the Software Engineering community, and social events. 


The conference will be held in conjunction with two satellite events: the Doctoral Symposium and the second version of the Ibero-American School on Software Engineering (EIbAIS). The Doctoral Symposium is organized to discuss work in progress of Ph.D. topics related to the general area of Software Engineering. The school will be led by renowned lecturers, offering an attractive program, combining lectures and tutorials based on the current trends in Software Engineering.


We invite you to submit papers to one or more of our main tracks:
   * SET - Software Engineering Track
   * RET - Requirements Engineering Track
   * ESELAW - Experimental Software Engineering Track


Papers can be submitted in any of the available categories (Technical Papers and Emerging Ideas) and the official CIbSE languages: English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Below, you will find the details of each track and the general organization committee.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
TRACKS AND PAPER CATEGORIES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
We invite authors to submit high-quality research papers describing significant, original, and not previously published results in any of the following tracks and categories:


Tracks
* SET - Software Engineering Track
* RET - Requirements Engineering Track
* ESELAW - Experimental Software Engineering Track


Categories


1. Technical Papers (not exceeding 14 pages): Technical papers should describe innovative research in the topics of the main tracks. Papers in this submission category should describe a novel contribution to the topics and should carefully support claims of novelty with citations to the relevant literature.
 
Evaluation criteria: Technical papers are evaluated by originality, soundness, relevance, the importance of contribution, the strength of validation, quality of presentation and appropriate comparison to related work. In case a submission builds upon the previous work of the author(s), the novelty of the new contribution must be described clearly concerning the previous work. Technical papers need to discuss openly how the results were validated.


2. Emerging Ideas Papers (not exceeding eight pages): Emerging ideas papers describe new, non-conventional approaches on the topics of the Foundations tracks, that depart from standard practice. They are intended to describe clear research ideas that are at an early stage of the investigation.



Evaluation criteria: Emerging ideas papers will be assessed primarily on their level of originality and potential for impact on the field regarding promoting innovative thinking. Hence, inadequacies in the state-of-the-art and the pertinence, correctness, and impact of the idea must be described precisely. While the idea that is described does not need to be fully validated, a presentation of preliminary results that provide initial insights into the feasibility and/or impact of the idea is expected. Provided acceptance, authors are asked to prepare a poster for presentation at the Poster Session. The Poster Session is separated from the Technical Papers¡¯ Sessions and shall allow authors to get immediate, personal feedback from conference attendees during the session in which they present their work. Posters also provide an opportunity to see new work in the field in a more relaxed setting to foster discussions and exchange of ideas.

CIbSE 2019 organizes a Doctoral Symposium Track (DS), aimed at disseminating research-in-progress conducted by novice researchers. A board of experts will discuss with the researchers to suggest new perspectives and improvements to the Ph.D. thesis.
The submitted research can address any of the CIbSE 2019 research topics. We recommend although it is not compulsory, that the research is at an intermediate stage (~ 2nd year) so that experts¡¯ suggestions could be included in the Ph.D. work.
The suggested paper structure is as follows:
* Introduction to the field of research and identification of the main challenges therein;
* Explicit formulation of the research questions and objectives justifying why they were chosen;
* Outline of the current knowledge of the problem domain as well as the state of existing  solutions;
* Sketch of the research methodology that is being applied;
* Introduction of the proposed solution and the results achieved so far;
* The statement in what aspects the suggested solution is different or better as compared to existing approaches;
* An indication of the outstanding issues and description of the next steps that are planned;
* Provision of a list of references.
 
Doctoral Symposium papers shall be authored by the doctoral candidate exclusively (thus, the name of the supervisor should not be included). All papers must be submitted in PDF format through EasyChair, using the link available in the CIbSE 2019 webpage. Submissions must be written in English, Portuguese, or Spanish. Moreover, the paper should not exceed eight pages, and it should be formatted according to the LNCS style. The authors of accepted DS papers must register by the camera-ready deadline.

IBERO-AMERICAN SCHOOL ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (EIbAIS)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
The Ibero-American School on Software Engineering (EIbAIS) represents the CIbSE initiative to disseminate software engineering knowledge in Ibero-America. It started as a natural evolution of the CIbSE tutorials and short courses, by including prospective topics in the field and non-exclusively regarding the main CIbSE tracks: technologies, experimentation, and requirements.  


EIbAIS aims to promote a forum for discussions regarding software engineering and its related technologies and theoretical foundations, allowing the participation of practitioners, undergraduate and graduate students and researchers in the activities.  


As in any CIbSE related activity, all lecturers are presented by volunteers engaged with contributing to CIbSE community and the spreading of Software Engineering knowledge in Ibero-America. However, depending on the number of registrations in EIbAIS and the CIbSE budget, some supporting for traveling and conference registration should be allocated for them. 


In its second issue, EIbAIS is going to be organized into two basic categories of plenary sessions for two days: state-of-the-practice and state-of-the-art modules. 


The modules regarding the state-of-the-practice offer discussions on topics of general interest and usually representing local demand. These modules support the amendment of knowledge and practical issues to the participants, presenting evidence-based software engineering results to the audience. Examples of state-of-practice topics include CASE tools, software testing of conventional systems, scenario-based specifications, surveys, controlled experiments, and so on.


The modules regarding the state-of-the-art offer discussion on topics of prospective interest and usually representing the software engineering community perspectives. These modules intend to provide information on ongoing and next to coming software engineering technologies candidates that could represent breakthroughs concepts in the field. Examples of state-of-the-art topics include requirements specification for Ubiquitous systems, software testing of context awareness systems, software engineering for the Internet of Everything, simulation-based experiments in software engineering, synthesis of evidence, and so on. 


All the participants that take part in the plenary sessions will get a certificate of participation, indicating the modules, lecturers, and contents. 


The main topics for both types of modules of 2nd EIbAIS are going to be announced soon!
