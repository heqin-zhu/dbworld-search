A doctoral candidate in computer science is sought to join an interdisciplinary, multinational team, to develop better risk communication tools for urban dwellers at risk of flooding. A PhD fellowship is offered in the School of Computer Sciences, University College Dublin. The position is funded through the international, multi-disciplinary collaboration ?UrbanARK: Assessment, Risk Management, &amp; Knowledge for Coastal Flood Risk Management in Urban Areas?, a US-Ireland R&amp;D Programme Funded project that will bring together teams from New York University in the US, Queens University Belfast in Northern Ireland, and University College Dublin in Ireland.

The PhD researcher will join multiple new research posts funded by the UrbanARK project across QUB, UCD and NYU and supported by the UrbanARK research team of eight (8) leading academic researchers.  The multinational project brings together leading researchers across the areas of geomatics, spatial data analysis, hydrology, computer science and risk communication to investigate innovative approaches for the collection and management of spatial data to refine flood risk assessments for urban coastal cities and to support immersive risk communication tools.  

The successful applicant will work to develop a new cloud-based storage model combined with new methods for parallel query processing in the context of flood risk assessment under the supervision of Prof. Michela Bertolotto (https://www.cs.ucd.ie/AcademicProfile/MichelaBertolotto) and Dr. Nhien-An Le-Khac (https://www.cs.ucd.ie/AcademicProfile/NhienAnLeKhac/). Applicants should have experience and/or interest in high performance computing, spatio-temporal databases, cloud computing, Map-Reduce programming, advanced information systems, and data analytics.

Eligibility criteria: applicants should hold a first or upper second class honours undergraduate degree and/or or an MSc in a relevant subject.

The scholarship covers the University fees and a stipend averaging ?18,500 per annum for the duration of four years. The application should include a cover letter and curriculum vitae (including the names and contact details of two referees), an example of your writing (e.g., publication, thesis, report, dissertation, etc.), and should be sent to Prof. Michela Bertolotto (michela.bertolotto@ucd.ie) or Dr. Nhien-An Le-Khac (an.lekhac@ucd.ie).

Expected start date: Jan. 1st, 2018.

Deadline for applications: Nov. 20th, 2018.
