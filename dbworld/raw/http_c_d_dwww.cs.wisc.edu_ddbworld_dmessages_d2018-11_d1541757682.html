Call for Submissions
--------------------
The ACM Multimedia Systems Conference (MMSys) provides a forum for researchers to present and share their latest research findings in multimedia systems. While research about specific aspects of multimedia systems are regularly published in the various proceedings and transactions of the networking, operating systems, real-time systems, databases, mobile computing, distributed systems, computer vision, and middleware communities, MMSys aims to cut across these domains in the context of multimedia data types. This provides a unique opportunity to investigate the intersections and the interplay of the various approaches and solutions developed across these domains to deal with multimedia data types.

MMSys is a venue for researchers who explore:
- Complete multimedia systems that provide a new kind of multimedia experience or system whose overall performance improves the state-of-the-art through new research results in more than one component, or
- Enhancements to one or more system components that provide a documented improvement over the state-of-the-art for handling continuous media or time-dependent services.

Such individual system components include:
- Operating systems
- Distributed architectures and protocols
- Domain languages, development tools and abstraction layers
- Using new architectures or computing resources for multimedia
- New or improved I/O architectures or I/O devices, innovative uses, and algorithms for their operation
- Representation of continuous or time-dependent media
- Metrics and measurement tools to assess performance

This touches aspects of many hot topics including but not limited to: content preparation and delivery systems, HDR, games, virtual/augmented/mixed reality, 3D video, immersive systems, plenoptics, 360? video, volumetric video delivery, multimedia IoT, multi and many-core, GPGPUs, mobile multimedia and 5G, wearable multimedia, P2P, cloud-based multimedia, cyber-physical systems, multi-sensory experiences, smart cities, QoE.

Special Sessions
----------------
- Machine learning and statistical modeling for video streaming
- Real-time video at the edge
- Advanced transport protocols for video
- Volumetric media: from capture to consumption
Refer to the Web site for more info. Submission, notification and camera-ready dates will be the same as for the research track.

Submission Information
----------------------
Papers should be between 6-12 pages long (in PDF format) prepared in the ACM style and written in English. MMSys papers enable authors to present entire multimedia systems or research work that builds on considerable amounts of earlier work in a self-contained manner. MMSys papers are published in the ACM Digital Library. The papers are double-blind reviewed.

All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three TPC members. All papers will be evaluated for their scientific quality. Authors will have a chance to submit their rebuttals before online discussions among the TPC members.

ACM SIGMM has a tradition of publishing open datasets (MMSys) and open source projects (ACM Multimedia). MMSys 2019 will continue to support scientific reproducibility, by implementing the ACM reproducibility badge system. All accepted papers will be contacted by the Reproducibility Chair, inviting the authors to make their dataset and code available, and thus, obtaining an ACM badge (visible at the ACM DL). The additional material will be published as Appendixes, with no effect on the final page count for papers.
