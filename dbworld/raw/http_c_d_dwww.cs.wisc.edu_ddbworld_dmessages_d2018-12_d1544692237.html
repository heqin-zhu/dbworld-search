====================================================================


MDM's PhD Forum (Doctoral Colloquium) provides an opportunity for matriculated PhD students and recent PhD graduates to present their dissertation research, recently finished or still ongoing, in all areas of mobile data management. The main objective of the Ph.D. Forum is to offer an opportunity to Ph.D. students to receive high-quality feedback from external reviewers and to directly interact with peers, exchange ideas, discuss concepts, and establish (in)formal cooperation with various research groups. The 2019 edition will be organized as a regular session with brief presentations by Ph.D. students and extended abstracts will appear in the proceedings of the conference.
Both, researchers currently enrolled in doctoral programs and graduates who completed their PhD dissertations since July 2018, are encouraged to submit extended abstracts. Submissions should be singled-authored while contributions of advisers and others may be acknowledged in the abstract. A peer-review process will ensure quality and relevance. 
Authors of accepted submissions are expected to register for MDM 2019 and to give a short presentation at the corresponding session. To encourage junior researchers to participate in the main MDM events, a special student rate for conference registration will be offered to the authors of accepted submissions. In addition, a number of best presentation awards will be given to the most innovative ideas/efforts presented at the PhD Forum.
