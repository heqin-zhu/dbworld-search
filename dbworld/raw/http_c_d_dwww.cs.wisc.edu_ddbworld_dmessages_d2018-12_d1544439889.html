Position overview
-----------------

The ANU College of Engineering and Computer Science (CECS) is dedicated to contributing to The Australian National University¡¯s reputation for excellence in research and research-led education, bringing together expertise across a range of areas to reimagine the role of engineering and computing for future generations. CECS is a diverse and vibrant community dedicated to discovery and to making knowledge matter. Our academics and students are engaged in ground-breaking, cutting-edge research, in exciting areas such as renewable energy, robotics, telecommunications, biomaterials, human-machine interaction, and artificial intelligence.

The position is located within the Research School of Computer Science (RSCS) in CECS, a close-knit research and teaching community, made up of high performing academic and professional staff, students and visitors sharing a deep commitment to transforming the future of engineering for the next generation. The appointee is accountable to the Project leader, Dr Armin Haller, and the Director of the Research School. The appointee will liaise with relevant professional and academic staff members within the Research School of Computer Science and the ANU as well as establishing relationships with the wider research community to enhance cross-disciplinary collaborations.

As an academic member of the Research School of Computer Science the appointee will be required to contribute to the overall intellectual life of the School, College and University. This includes contribution to research, education and outreach agendas of the School both nationally and internationally in a manner that is appropriate to the level of appointment. The appointee is expected to undertake independent research activities that are aligned with the School¡¯s strategic priorities that emphasise relevant and translational research.

This position is a fixed term for a period of three (3) years appointment to contribute to the objectives of an externally funded project with the Department of Finance on ¡°An ontology framework for government information¡±. Applications are particularly invited from researchers whose expertise are in the areas of Ontology Engineering, Machine Learning, Knowledge Graphs, the semantic Web and Linked Data and whose breadth of vision reaches across traditional discipline silos. We welcome and develop diversity of backgrounds, experiences and ideas and encourage applications from individuals who may have had non-traditional career paths, who may have taken a career break or who have achieved excellence in careers outside of academia.
