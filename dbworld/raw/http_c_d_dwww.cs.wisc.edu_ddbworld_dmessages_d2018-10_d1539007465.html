  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Second (2019) IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Information Processing and Retrieval (MIPR'19)

<a href="http://www.ieee-mipr.org">http://www.ieee-mipr.org</a> 
San Jose, CA, USA
March 28-30, 2019

[The deadline for regular paper submission has extended, please refer to the Important Dates section in this CFP]

New forms of multimedia data (such as text, numbers, tags, networking, signals, 
geo-tagged information, graphs/relationships, 3D/VR/AR and sensor data, etc.) 
has emerged in many applications in addition to traditional multimedia data 
(image, video, audio). Multimedia has become the biggest of big data as 
the foundation of today's data-driven discoveries. Almost all disciplines of 
science and engineering, as well as social sciences, involve multimedia data 
in some forms, such as recording experiments, driverless cars, unmanned aerial 
vehicles, smart communities, biomedical instruments, security surveillance. 
Some recent events demonstrate the power of real-time broadcast of unfolding 
events on social networks. Multimedia data is not just big in volume, but also 
multi-modal and mostly unstructured. Storing, indexing, searching, integrating, 
and recognizing from the vast amounts of data create unprecedented challenges. 
Even though significant progress has been made processing multimedia data, 
today's solutions are inadequate in handling data from millions of sources 
simultaneously. 

The IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Information 
Processing and Retrieval (IEEE-MIPR) aims to provide a forum for original research 
contributions and practical system design, implementation, and applications 
of multimedia information processing and retrieval for single modality or 
multiple modalities. The target audiences will be university researchers, 
scientists, industry practitioners, software engineers, and graduate students 
who need to become acquainted with technologies for big data analytics, machine 
intelligence, information fusion in multimedia information processing and retrieval. 
A collection of keynotes, open panels, and workshops will be held, together 
with paper/poster sessions.

The conference will accept regular papers (6 pages), short papers (4 pages), 
and demo papers (2 pages). Authors are encouraged to compare their approaches, 
qualitatively or quantitatively, with existing work and explain the strength 
and weakness of the new approaches. Selected submissions will be invited to submit 
to journal special issues.

data processing and retrieval.
