Aims:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The complexity of Big Data technologies and the variety of knowledge and skills
needed to design Big Data applications have emphasized the relevance of systems 
for managing and documenting Big Data architectures. Documentation, 
reconfiguration, and verification are crucial tasks for a solid 
design of technological solutions, but are only partially supported in the 
current landscape of Big Data technologies. Rethinking data and metadata 
management in the context of Big Data technologies is then a primary goal for 
future research.

Methods, principles, and perspectives developed by the Data Semantics community 
can significantly contribute to the aformentioned issues. Solutions for 
integrating and querying schema-less data, have received much attention. 
Standards for metadata management have been proposed to improve data integration 
among silos and to make data more discoverable and accessible through 
heterogeneous infrastructures. A further level of application of Data Semantics 
principles in Big Data technologies involves Representing Processes, i.e.  
the entire pipeline of technologies connected to achieve a specific solution 
and to make this representation shareable and verifiable to support a mature 
implementation of the Big Data production cycle. 

Following the manifesto paper "Big Data Semantics" (J. Data Semantics 7(2), 
2018), which identified the important and yet unsolved issues of managing 
semantics of Big Data, we continue research on this topic. The aim of this 
special issue of FCDS is to promote research on Big Data semantics and to 
create a common place for sharing contributions to this topic.
