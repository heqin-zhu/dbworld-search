CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION: PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE (WILEY)

SPECIAL ISSUE ON "Cryptocurrencies and Blockchains for Distributed Systems"

SUBMISSION DEADLINE: October 31, 2018 (EXTENDED)

THEME:

The Internet is evolving into a new multi-factor paradigm based around 
smart systems, Internet of Things, new distributed data structures (e.g.
blockchains) and digital assets (e.g. cryptocurrencies). In the next
years, these technologies will converge and interact, fostering novel
services, business models and applications. Indeed, the blockchain can
provide an automated and secure transaction infrastructure for next
generation Internet of Things (IoT), mobile and smart systems while the
voluntary user participation to the mining of cryptocurrencies could
permit the development of new distributed services (i.e. offering an
alternative to the advertisement-based revenue system used by most of 
the "free services" that are currently available). This special issue 
aims to collect contributes from researchers and practitioners, coming
from academia and industry, to focus on the new challenges posed by the
novel technologies and applications that are based on the blockchains
infrastructure. The goal is to improve the state of the art on theory,
progresses, development, deployment and on the practical usage of
cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies, smart contracts, etc.
We are interested both in innovative works in an unexplored and/or
emerging topic in the broad area of distributed systems (e.g., mobile
systems, devices and applications, vehicular and robotic systems, IoT),
and in novel findings and/or new insights that build on existing works.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- All kind of blockchain based distributed systems
- Distributed (smart) systems relying on cryptocurrencies and smart contracts
- Blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT)
- Blockchain and mobile systems
- Vehicular services based on cryptocurrencies and blockchain
- Use of blockchain to support mobile smart services and applications
- Blockchain in crowdsourcing and crowdsensing
- Blockchain in 5G
- Blockchain in edge and cloud computing
- Use of blockchain in Smart Cities
- Blockchain schemes for decentralization
- Blockchain-inspired or alternative byzantine fault tolerance
- Performance optimization of blockchain and decentralized schemes
- Use of blockchain in healthcare applications
- Blockchains¡¯ energy consumption issues
- Security related issues in cryptocurrencies and blockchain
- Use of blockchain in distributed simulation
- Use of cryptocurrencies in public volunteer computing
- Cryptocurrencies and blockchain usage in online gaming architectures and digital virtual environments
- Multi-Agent Systems for modelling the usage of cryptocurrencies
- Decentralized processing, computing, and storage infrastructure
- Testing mechanisms to increase interoperability, robustness, stability, and confidence in blockchain systems
