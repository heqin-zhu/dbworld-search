  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">ICDT 2019 Test of Time Award

In 2013, the International Conference on Database Theory (ICDT) began
awarding the ICDT test-of-time (ToT) award, with the goal of
recognizing one paper, or a small number of papers, presented at ICDT
a decade earlier that have best met the "test of time". In 2019, the
award recognizes a paper from the ICDT 2009 proceedings that has
had the most impact in terms of research, methodology, conceptual
contribution, or transfer to practice over the past decade. The award
will be presented during the EDBT/ICDT 2019 Joint Conference, March
26-29, 2019, in Lisbon, Portugal.

The 2016 ToT Committee consists of Wenfei Fan (chair), Magdalena Ortiz,
and Ke Yi. After careful consideration and soliciting external 
assessments, the committee has chosen the following recipient of the
2019 ICDT Test of Time Award:

Automatic verification of data-centric business processes
Alin Deutsch, Richard Hull, Fabio Patrizi, Victor Vianu

The paper has been a cornerstone in the research on artifact-centric
and data-aware processes. It opens up the possibility of verifying
data-aware processes not only in niche cases but also in quite broad
classes. It provides a formalization of IBM's artifact-based approach
to business processes, and models arbitrary inputs from external users
with infinite domains. This gives rise to processes that have infinite
states and hence are impossible to verify through standard model checking
techniques. In addition to this formalization, it investigates
verification of properties in an extension of LTL over artifacts,
which is challenging since it deals with infinite alphabets.

The paper has generated impact not only on database and business
process communities, but also influenced artificial intelligence,
verification and Web services. It has received over 250 citations
coming from these diverse communities. In addition, its techniques
have influenced theoretical work on fundamental aspects of languages
over infinite alphabets.
