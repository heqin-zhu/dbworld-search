  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Research and Software Engineering Positions in Innovation Projects for Industry 4.0, Smart Manufacturing and Internet Platform Technologies at Salzburg Research, Austria.
 
We have up to four open positions for post-graduate or post-doc candidates wishing to work with the latest software technologies for smart manufacturing and cloud-based Internet Platforms.

---- Who are we? ----
Salzburg Research is an ICT research and development firm financed to one third by local government and to two thirds by external research contracts. We are over 60 people organized in four research groups.
 
Salzburg Research?s IOT group is active (as coordinator and research partner) in several EU ICT projects as well as in large national R&amp;D projects, always in collaboration with industry partners. We follow a permissive open source strategy (typically Apache 2.0 or similar) that makes it possible for partners and employees alike, to re-use our results for commercial or academic follow-up.
 
We are now entering a new large scale European project and have several national and European projects ongoing. We therefore want to extend and strengthen our team in four areas
-       UX/UI development, e.g. for web-based supply chain and logistics applications
-       Cloud software design, development and deployment of Internet Platforms
-       Cybersecurity, privacy, trust and reputation
-       Machine Learning and data analytics
 

---- Who are you? ----
You have a BSc degree in software engineering and solid experience in developing microservice-based systems, or MSc/ PhD in Computer Science, Mathematics or Engineering with a solid background in Cybersecurity and Machine Learning,  and you enjoy applied research and development. We are specifically looking for people who are developing open source software, and who are well versed in Java or Python.
 
In order to qualify for the above jobs, you need to have significant practical knowledge in one of the above areas and the willingness to spend the next three years with us. We typically offer open-term contracts so as long as we are successful as a group, you will have the opportunity to work with us.
 
Here is a more detailed description of each of the profiles we are looking for:
 
---- Ideal candidate profile for UI/UX: ----

-       Negotiate, create and ensure that user experience and interaction are key parts of the design and delivery process
-       Research heavily into user experience and what people want from a product
-       Analyse user feedback and data to determine improvements and tweaks to existing user interfaces
-       Be able to blueprint and storyboard a project
-       Wireframing and UI prototyping skills
-       Have extensive knowledge of programming, web design, and UX design in general
-       Use HTML5, Angular, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS/Sass, Bootstrap, mobile web applications 

---- Ideal candidate profile for cloud software design, development and deployment of Internet Platforms ----
 
You are knowledgeable in the latest cloud and Internet Platform technologies and you have already a strong understanding of microservices architectures and an extended experience in developing microservices:
-    Experience with DevOps tools including Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry, Jenkins CI (Continuous Integration) processes and systems, etc.
-    Experience in API design and development of RESTful services, e.g. using JSON
-    Experience in designing data persistence layers using NOSQL and SQL databases,
-    Experience in database management, data visualization, data transformation and migration
-    Event streaming and design of messaging patterns for microservices (RabbitMQ, Kafka Streams, Kafka Connect, IBM Message Hub and other streaming and messaging platforms,
-    Experience with authentication (OAuth2, OpenID Connect) and authorization of APIs
-    Experience with test driven development (TDD) to ensure code and design quality
 
---- Ideal candidate profile for Security, Privacy, Trust and Reputation ----
 
You are knowledgeable in the field of Cybersecurity architectures and have done an MSc or PhD project where security was at the center of the investigation. You have knowledge and understanding of:
-       Built-in security and privacy mechanisms during the development stages of software systems (i.e. identity management, authentication, authorization, access controls) and data centres (data/message integrity, data encryption)
-       Security and privacy challenges in a microservice world (e.g. secrets management API in Kubernetes, Docker/Swarm, Keycloak)
-       Security and privacy dashboards for monitoring for attacks and intrusions; looking for vulnerabilities and risks in APIs, applications, services, hardware
-       Using data and Machine Learning techniques to detect anomalies and uncover attackers, fraud and system failures
 
 
---- Ideal candidate profile for machine learning and data analytics ----
 
You are knowledgeable in data science methods and tools with a sound mathematical and statistics grounding. You have excellent skills in probability theory and programming languages (e.g. Java, Python, SciPy, R, Spark), and specifically:
-    Experience in ML problem specification (framing), data exploration, data structures, data evaluation, data cleansing
-    Hands-on experience in ML methods including data visualization
-    Solid background in Deep Learning and skills in using Deep Learning libraries, e.g. TensorFlow, PyTorch.
-    Experience with recommendation systems (e.g. collaborative filtering, hybrid recommendation) and methods for unstructured data analysis (e.g. text mining) is a plus.
