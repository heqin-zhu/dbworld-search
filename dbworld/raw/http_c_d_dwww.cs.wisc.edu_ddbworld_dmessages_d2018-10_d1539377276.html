  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Department of Psychology at Colorado State University invites applications for a tenure-track faculty position at the rank of Assistant Professor in INDUSTRIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL (IO) PSYCHOLOGY with an appointment date of August 16, 2019. 

Priority will be given to candidates with research expertise in Data Science and IO. Data Science is considered a multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary field that connects business, statistics, computer science and/or software programming, behavioral sciences, and communication. Although the specific research focus is open, a primary research program that uses modern ¡°Big Data¡± methods for data collection and analysis (e.g., machine learning algorithms, data mining, predictive modeling, statistical modeling, learning analytics) with naturally occurring data sets applied to IO is highly desirable. Candidates should be able to teach undergraduate and graduate level coursework in IO psychology, and specialty courses related to their area of research interest in data science or applications of data science to IO. Required qualifications: Ph.D., or anticipated Ph.D. completion by 07/30/2019 in Psychology or related discipline. Individuals with an equivalent degree in a closely related area to Psychology, IO, and/or Data Science will be considered with evidence of IO related research and ability to teach graduate and undergraduate courses in psychology. Preferred qualifications: Priority may be given to candidates with one or more of the following preferred qualifications: (1) Active research program related to Data Science and/or IO. Our emphasis is on a data scientist with an IO background, to teach, mentor students, and conduct research that is relevant to IO psychology. Candidates with a clear and consistent record of publication in Data Science relevant to IO psychology will be preferred over candidates whose publication records are primarily outside of Data Science and/or IO, but who have a few data science-related or IO publications. (2) Ability to collaborate with and develop partnerships across campus with colleagues in other data science-related fields; (3) have experience in undergraduate and/or graduate instruction and mentoring; (4) demonstrate ongoing commitment to and the capability of obtaining external research funding; and (5) show a continuous commitment to diversity, inclusion, and social justice (see special instructions below). Although the specific area of research interest within data science and IO is open, successful candidates will be expected to be able to (6) teach core curricular classes within the Department of Psychology, including Industrial and/or Organizational psychology and Data Science; (7) teach advanced quantitative methods and/or methods in Data Science for psychology graduate students; (8) provide evidence of teaching graduate and undergraduate courses in industrial psychology; and (9) teach psychological measurement, methods, and advanced statistical analyses such as SEM and longitudinal analyses.
