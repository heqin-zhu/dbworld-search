Workshop Scope
==============
Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI) is concerned with the 
study of the development and use of advanced information 
technologies and systems for national, international, and societal 
security-related applications. The annual IEEE International 
Conference series on ISI was started in 2003. In 2006, the Workshop
 on ISI was started in Singapore in conjunction with PAKDD, with
 most contributors and participants from the Pacific Asian region. 
Since then, PAISI was held annually in Chengdu (2007), Taipei (2008), 
Bangkok (2009), Hyderabad (2010), Beijing (2011), Kuala Lumpur (2012), 
Beijing (2013), Tainan (2014), Ho Chi Minh City (2015), Auckland (2016), 
Jeju (2017), and Melbourne (2018). This year PAISI 2019 will once again 
be held in conjunction with PAKDD (<a href="http://pakdd2019.medmeeting.org/en">http://pakdd2019.medmeeting.org/en</a>) and
 will provide a stimulating forum for ISI researchers in Pacific Asia and 
other regions of the world to exchange ideas and report research 
progress.
