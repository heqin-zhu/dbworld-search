The Hot Topics of AIMS 2019: Real-world Solutions and Growing Ecosystems 

==================================== 

AIMS 2019 organizing committee invites you to participate in 2019 edition of AIMS, to be held on June 25-June 30 2019, San Diego, USA. 

Regular Theme of AIMS 2019: Mobile and AI applications 

AI has revolutionized the computing paradigm in multiple domains, such as economics, finance, e-commence,etc. AI provide the abilities to link cyberspace and physcial space, and social space. AI as a service will greatly reshape current techonglogies. Also wireless and ubiquitous connectivity have enabled mobile computing and Internet access on the go as a life-enhancing and indispensable experience of modern life. More than 50 billion devices, in more than 200 device types, will likely be connected to the Internet by 2020 as integral components of a new generation of high-value application services for consumers and enterprises. API-defined mobile services have become essential ubiquitous services consumption and delivery enablers for many industries and government organizations worldwide. The 2019 International Conference on AI &amp; Mobile Services (AIMS) aims at providing an international forum that is dedicated to exploring different aspects of AI( from technologies to approaches and algorithms) and mobile services (from business management to computing systems, algorithms, and applications) and to promoting technological innovations in research and development of AI and mobile services, including, but not limited to, wireless &amp; sensor networks, mobile &amp; wearable computing, mobile enterprise &amp; eCommerce, ubiquitous collaborative &amp; social services, machine-to-machine &amp; Internet-of-things clouds, cyber-physical integration, big data analytics for mobility-enabled services, and AI &amp; machine learning theory, algorithms &amp; applications. 

AI and Mobile Services have been driving Internet innovations and transforming traditional businesses since iOS, Andriod, Windows Phone, and other mobile operating systems were introduced. We are leveraging AI and mobile platforms such as WeChat, QQ, Facebook, Twitter, and others to analyze business opportunities, play games, conduct transactions, collaborate with team members, sell products, build relationships with e-commerce partners, create friend-circles, and manage projects as well as tasks. As an open platform, The Hot Topics of the 2019 International Conference on AI &amp; Mobile Services (AIMS 2019) is created to promote real-world solutions and growing ecosystems.

SCF Policy and professional ethics require that referees treat the contents of papers under review as privileged information not to be disclosed to others before publication. It is expected that no one with access to a paper under review will make any inappropriate use of the special knowledge, which that access provides. Contents of abstracts submitted to conference program committees should be regarded as privileged as well, and handled in the same manner. The Conference Publications Chair shall ensure that referees adhere to this practice. 

Organizers of SCF conferences are expected to provide an appropriate forum for the oral presentation and discussion of all accepted papers. An author, in offering a paper for presentation at a SCF conference, or accepting an invitation to present a paper, is expected to be present at the meeting to deliver the paper. In the event that circumstances unknown at the time of submission of a paper preclude its presentation by an author, the program chair should be informed on time, and appropriate substitute arrangements should be made. In some cases it may help reduce no-shows for the Conference to require advance registration together with the submission of the final manuscript. 
About the Services Society 

The Services Society (S2) is a non-profit professional organization that has been created to promote worldwide research and technical collaboration in services innovations among academia and industrial professionals. Its members are volunteers from industry and academia with common interests. S2 is registered in the USA as a "501(c) organization", which means that it is an American tax-exempt nonprofit organization. S2 collaborates with other professional organizations to sponsor or co-sponsor conferences and to promote an effective services curriculum in colleges and universities. The S2 initiates and promotes a "Services University" program worldwide to bridge the gap between industrial needs and university instruction. The Services Society has formed 10 Special Interest Groups (SIGs) to support technology and domain specific professional activities.

SCF As A Platform 

-- SCF 2019 Defines Future of New ABC (AI, Blockchain &amp; Cloud) 

The International Conference on Web Services (ICWS) was first conceived in June 2003 in Las Vegas, USA. Meanwhile, the First International Conference on Web Services - Europe 2003 (ICWS-Europe'03) was held in Germany in Oct, 2003. ICWS-Europe'03 is an extended event of the 2003 International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2003) in Europe. In 2004, ICWS-Europe was changed to the European Conference on Web Services (ECOWS), which was held at Erfurt, Germany. In the last year, SCF 2018 was held successfully in Seattle, USA. To celebrate its 17-year-old birthday, ICWS 2019 will be held on June 25 - June 30, 2019, San Diego, USA. 
In the past 16 years, ICWS community has been expanded from Web engineering innovations to scientific research for the whole services industry. 

The service delivery platforms have been expanded to mobile platforms, Internet of Things, cloud computing, and edge computing. The services ecosystem is gradually enabled, value added, and intelligence embedded through enabling technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, and cognitive computing. In the coming years, all the transactions with multiple parties involved will be transformed to blockchain. 

Based on the technology trends and best practices in the field, the Services Conference Federation (SCF) was created as a conference umbrella's code name for all services-related conferences. Today, we are very proud to announce that SCF 2019's 10 co-located theme topic conferences will all center around "services", while each focusing on exploring different themes (web-based services, cloud-based services, Big Data-based services, services innovation lifecycle, AI-driven ubiquitous services, blockchain driven trust service-ecosystems, industry-specific services and applications, and emerging service-oriented technologies) 
SCF 2019 Highlights: 

- Bigger Platform: The he 10 collocated conferences (SCF 2019) get sponsorship from the Services Society which is the largest not-for-profits organization (501 c(3)) dedicated for serving more than 30,000 worldwide researchers and practitioners. Bigger platform means bigger opportunities to all volunteers. Meanwhile, Springer provides sponsorship to best paper awards and other professional activities. All the 10 conference proceedings will be published by Springer and indexed in ISI Conference Proceedings Citation Index (included in Web of Science), Engineering Index EI (Compendex and Inspec databases), DBLP, Google Scholar, IO-Port, MathSciNet, Scopus, and ZBlMath. 

- Brighter Future: SCF launches the Second International Conference on Blockchain (ICBC 2019) to build the fundamental infrastructure for enabling secure and trusted services ecosystems. It will also lead our community members to create their own brighter future. 

- Better Model: SCF 2019 leverages the invented Conference Blockchain Model (CBM) to innovate the organizing practices for all the 10 theme conferences. Senior researchers in the field are welcome to submit proposals to serve as CBM Ambassador for an individual conference to start better interactions during your leadership practices for organizing SCF 2019. 

Look forward to your great contributions as a volunteer, author, and conference participant for the fast-growing worldwide services innovations community. If you would like to contribute to SCF 2019 as a leading volunteer or try the new Conference Blockchain Model, please feel free to fill in the online form (<a href="http://icws.org/2019/open.html">http://icws.org/2019/open.html</a>) to become a conference volunteer. For other queries or questions, please feel free to visit our conference web sites and find contact information on SCF 2019. 

See you all on June 25 - June 30, 2019, San Diego, USA.
