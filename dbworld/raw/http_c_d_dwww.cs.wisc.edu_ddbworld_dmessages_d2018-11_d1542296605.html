https://easychair.org/cfp/TOOLS-50_1?



------------------------------

This new edition of the TOOLS conference series revives a tradition going back 50 conferences from 1989 to 2012. TOOLS was originally ?Technology of Object-Oriented?Languages and Systems? and grew to encompass all innovative aspects of software technology. Many of today?s most important software concepts were first introduced there.?The 2019 TOOLS 50+1, taking place near Kazan, in Russia, continues the series in the same spirit of creativity, passion for everything software-related, combination of scientific?soundness and industrial applicability, and an open attitude welcoming all trends and communities in the field.

TOOLS 51 will be held in the week of October 14, 2019, ?with the conference proper on October 15 to 17 (Tuesday to Thursday) and colocated events on the surrounding days.?Proposers of colocated events are welcome to contact organizers. The conference location is the ?campus of Innopolis University, a new IT-only university, part of the recently?created Innopolis technology city near Kazan, one of the main historic centers of Russia, capital of Tatarstan and about 800 kilometers from Moscow, easily reached by domestic?and international flights as well as train. For an excellent conference experience, participants will be housed on site, and will benefit from tours of Kazan and neighboring?attractions. The conference organizers will provide travel and visa assistance.
