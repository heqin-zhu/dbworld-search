CALL FOR NOMINATIONS
PODS 2019 TEST-OF-TIME AWARD 

Nominations are solicited for the PODS 2019 Test of Time Award.
The award will recognize a paper or a small number of papers published in the PODS 2009 proceedings 
that had the most impact in terms of research, methodology, or transfer to practice over the intervening decade.
All papers are nominated by default, but the committee welcomes input from our community.
Please feel free to nominate a paper if you think it has had great impact,
even if you have not thoroughly compared it to the other eligible papers.
The usual conflict of interest rules apply.

The PODS 2019 ToT Award Committee consists of Dirk Van Gucht, Jianwen Su, and Victor Vianu (chair). 
Please email your nominations to Victor (vianu@cs.ucsd.edu) with subject line

Please send your nominations no later than December 15, 2018.
Nominations are confidential and will only be shared among the committee members.
