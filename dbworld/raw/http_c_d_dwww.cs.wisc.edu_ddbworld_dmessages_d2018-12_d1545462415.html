AsianPLoP 2019: 8th Asian Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs
Mar 20-22, 2019, Tokyo, Japan
<a href="http://asianplop.org">http://asianplop.org</a>

AsianPLoP 2019 is a PLoP(R) Conference sanctioned by the Hillside Group. 
PLoP is a registered trademark of the Hillside Group.

*Objective and Motivation*

A pattern is a solution to a recurring problem in a certain context 
where numerous forces are felt. Patterns enable people to share 
experience-based proven solutions in designing products, managing 
processes, projects and organizations, and communicating with each 
other more efficiently and effectively.

Asian Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs (AsianPLoP) will take 
place for the fifth time, as a premier event for pattern authors and 
users to get together, discuss and learn more about patterns and 
pattern languages in the Asia region as well as other regions. The 
purpose of AsianPLoP is to promote development of patterns, pattern 
languages, technologies and experiences of patterns primarily about 
software as well as domains.

AsianPLoP 2019 solicits paper submissions that are written in any one 
the two languages: English and Japanese. Papers in each of the two 
languages will have their own sessions. Both practitioners from the 
industry and academics are invited to submit their papers. The 
conference solicits the papers for the following different sessions. 
Details can be found in Topics and Submission.

- Writers' Workshop: papers that document patterns and pattern 
languages will be workshopped in the traditional PLoP format. 
Papers that explore theories, techniques, applications, tools and 
case studies in patterns are also welcome.

- Writing Group: papers of newcomers who want to learn how to better 
elaborate an idea intended to evolve into a pattern or pattern 
language. This is more like a hands-on tutorial on writing patterns.

*Venue*

Life is Tech!
2-12-3 Minamiazabu, Minato-ku, Tokyo 1060047 Japan
5min walk from Shirokane-takanawa Station (Tokyo Metro, Tokyo Subway)

*Topics*

Suggested topic areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

- New software patterns and pattern languages in software: 
  e.g., design patterns, security patterns and agile patterns

- New patterns and pattern languages in non-software areas: e.g., 
  learning patterns and social communication patterns

- Critiques, researches, and case studies of patterns and pattern languages

*Machine Learning Engineering Group*

In addition to the above-mentioned general topics, this year AsianPLoP 
organizers collaborate with JSSST Special Interest Group on Machine 
Learning Systems (MLSE, https://mlxse.connpass.com/ ) to solicit patterns 
for machine learning systems and engineering. 

*Submission*

After submission, papers will be screened by the program committee 
to be accepted for the shepherding process. Authors of each 
accepted paper will be assigned a shepherd who helps the authors 
to improve the content and style of the paper. At the end of the 
shepherding process, papers will be reviewed again to be accepted 
into the Writers' Workshops of the conference. 
Submission site will be available shortly. 

*Paper style*

Paper submissions may include short papers (e.g. 1 page), containing 
one or more patterns, longer pattern languages or sequences (e.g. 
10 pages), or work-in-progress papers willing to get an in-depth 
shepherding by an experienced pattern author at the conference.

AsianPLoP 2019 solicit submissions in English, and Japanese.

There is no specific paper format; however the ACM conference format 
is recommended.

*Publication*

Accepted papers of the workshop will be published in the workshop 
on-line proceedings. Please note that at least one of the authors 
of each accepted paper must register as a full participant of the 
conference to have the paper published in the conference on-line 
proceedings and the post-proceedings.

Papers discussed at Writers Workshop qualify for submission to the 
journal "TPLoP - Transactions on Pattern Languages of Programming" 
published by Springer.
