Scope
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This conference aims at stimulating the debate between scholars of different disciplines about the
so called "data revolution" in social research. Statisticians, computer scientists and domain experts
in social research will discuss the opportunities and challenges of the social data revolution to
create a fertile ground for addressing new research problems.

The Data Science and Social Research international conference encourages contributions about:

* new methodological developments to extract social knowledge from large scale data sets;
* new social research about human behavior and society with large datasets, either mined from various
sources (e.g. social media, communication systems) or created via controlled experiments;
* integrated systems to take advantage of new social data sources;
* big data quality issues, both as reformulation of traditional representativeness and validity and as
emerging quality aspects such as access constraints, which may produce inequalities.
