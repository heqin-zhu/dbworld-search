  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The University of Cadiz (UCA), Spain, offers an industrial PhD thesis position in Robotic Process Automation (RPA) in collaboration with Novayre Solutions. 

Software Robot technology (also known as RPA) represents a new paradigm in business process automation. Robots are programs that control other applications to perform repetitive and rule-based tasks. They allow people to focus their efforts on activities that require creativity and cognitive interpretation. Similar to the manufacturing sector, where robotics revolutionized productivity and quality, Software Robots are transforming the way companies manage their back and front office processes, drastically improving accuracy, speed and efficiency.

Novayre Solutions is a technology services enterprise specializing in software development, integration and automation, and creator of JIDOKA (https://www.jidoka.io/en/), which has been chosen by Gartner as Representative RPA Vendor in the latest "Market Guide for Robotic Process Automation Software".
