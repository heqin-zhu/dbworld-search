4th IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy
Stockholm, Sweden -- June 17-19, 2019
https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/EuroSP2019/

Since 1980, the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy has been the
premier forum for presenting developments in computer security and
electronic privacy, and for bringing together researchers and
practitioners in the field. Following this story of success, IEEE
initiated the European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&amp;P),
which is organized every year in a European city. The 4th EuroS&amp;P
edition will be held on June 17-19, 2019 in Stockholm, at the KTH main
campus. Pre conference workshops will take place on Sunday, June 16,
2019, and post conference workshops on Thursday, June 20, 2019.

A workshop associated with IEEE EuroS&amp;P can be a full or half day in
length. Each workshop should provide a forum to address a specific
topic at the forefront of security and privacy research.

Submissions of workshop proposals must reach the workshop chairs by
November 11, 2018.

If proceedings are planned, the default option offered is publication
through IEEE Xplore in a volume accompanying the main IEEE EuroS&amp;P
2019 proceedings.

Workshop registration will be done together with the main conference,
allowing workshop-only registrations as well. Support for accepted
workshops include: rooms, coffee breaks, lunches, and at least two free
registrations for the full EuroS&amp;P 2019 program. Other expenses must
be covered by the individual workshops.
