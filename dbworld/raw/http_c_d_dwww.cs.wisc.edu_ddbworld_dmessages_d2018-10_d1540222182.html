  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">As of May 25th  2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) started to apply after a long-lasting legislative process. With this regulation, the EU has legislated for a robust solution, which addresses individual rights and relevant obligations of service providers, and is directly applicable to all EU Member States. Additionally, the forthcoming Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications is expected to give new impetus to the way privacy is protected in electronic communications.

Despite the undisputable importance of the aforementioned legal developments, the practical implementation of privacy and data protection requirements is not always easy. This is largely due to the lack of proper integration of these requirements in the ?heart? of systems operation ?by design? and ?by default?. At the same time, in an era of new technological challenges, such as Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence, personal data may be processed by an unknown chain of entities, often leading to loss of control on the individuals? side, detailed profiling or other unexpected processing of data. Therefore, examining what is at stake and where threats thereto originate from becomes of paramount importance.

In the light of the above, ENISA, DG CONNECT, the University of Rome Tor Vergata and LUISS University are organizing the Annual Privacy Forum (APF) 2019.

In APF 2019, we invite papers presenting original work on the themes of data protection and privacy and their repercussions on technology, business, government, law, society, policy and law enforcement. An inter-disciplinary approach is high in demand to contribute to bridging the gap between research, business models and policy, much like proposing new models and interpretations.

The full CfP is available at https://privacyforum.eu/call-for-papers

Submission can be made through Easychair at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=apf2019.

APF 2019 seeks contributions from policy makers and implementers, Data Protection Authorities, industry, consultants, researchers, NGOs and as well as civil society. Opinion and interpretation papers are expected to reflect the views of the author(s). Submissions can be up to 8000 words long, excluding bibliography and appendices. Both research and opinion papers should deal with at least one of the following aspects:

Implementation Aspects:
- Privacy "by design" and "by default" paradigms
- Adoption of PETs in contemporary digital services
- State-of-the-art and development of PETs
- Technical solutions for data portability and procedural issues
- Technical solutions for preventing online and mobile tracking
- Technical solutions for the enforcement and the implications of the subject?s right, e.g. right to erasure, access and correction
- Information and consent in online environments: practical solutions and implementations 
Modelling of data protection and privacy requirements, such as:
- Machine readable representations and automatic evaluation of policies
- Enabling transparency: technological and organizational challenges
- Aspects of privacy in artificial intelligence, autonomous agents, Internet of Things
- Practical implementation of GDPR and ePrivacy requirements 
Sustainable business models and trustworthiness assessment for privacy friendly online services
- Aspects of privacy impact and risk assessment
- Security measures for the protection of personal data
