Aims and Scope:
==============

Dear Colleagues,

Advances in computer technologies are driving significant changes in medical care by shifting the hospital-centered paradigm to a patient-centered one. The focus on disease is replaced with the orientation to wellness. Monitoring and analyzing biomedical variables are key activities required for diagnosis and health care. The automation of these activities by means of computing systems allows processing massive volumes of data collected from biomedical sensors, leading to useful field applications to health personnel. This is particularly interesting to predict the diagnosis of certain diseases suffered by the most vulnerable groups, like the elderly. New systems, applications, developments, models, and research that make use of monitored medical data are envisaged to bring differentiated services to the society.

Big Data and Machine Learning provide significant potential for this purpose, leading to new applications, more effective operations, and more human approaches. These methodologies enable digging massive databases, enhancing the knowledge base and producing new data model-based applications and services for society. The most significant requirement for these technologies is the availability of databases to mine them or to train and test the models. However, medical information is hard to obtain for administrative issues, so other efficient alternatives to collect data are required. The use of smart sensors requires strategies to minimize interference with the work of health personnel and have a minimal impact on monitored patients. The implementation of health-care services with these technologies will probably save costs, but the benefits will be better perceived as an increment of the satisfaction of patients and personnel. Moreover, these technological implementations will expand accessibility to new areas.

This Special Issue provides a collection of papers of original advances in health applications and services propelled by artificial intelligence, big data, and machine learning, supported by the design of biosensor systems for the construction of trustable medical databases. Papers about advancements in pattern recognition techniques, intelligent algorithms, automated data analysis, sensor-fusion techniques, and smart sensing, which focus on existing issues in biomedical sensing and diagnostics, are welcomed.

Manuscript Submission Information:
=================================

Manuscripts should be submitted online at www.mdpi.com by registering and logging in to this website. Manuscripts can be submitted until the deadline. All papers will be peer-reviewed. Accepted papers will be published continuously in the journal (as soon as accepted) and will be listed together on the special issue website. Research articles, review articles as well as short communications are invited. For planned papers, a title and short abstract (about 100 words) can be sent to the Editorial Office for announcement on this website.

Submitted manuscripts should not have been published previously, nor be under consideration for publication elsewhere (except conference proceedings papers). All manuscripts are thoroughly refereed through a single-blind peer-review process. A guide for authors and other relevant information for submission of manuscripts is available on the Instructions for Authors page. Applied Sciences is an international peer-reviewed open access monthly journal published by MDPI.

Please visit the Instructions for Authors page before submitting a manuscript. The Article Processing Charge (APC) for publication in this open access journal is 1400 CHF (Swiss Francs). Submitted papers should be well formatted and use good English. Authors may use MDPI's English editing service prior to publication or during author revisions.
