*Positions Descriptions*
The College of Informatics (<a href="http://informatics.nku.edu">http://informatics.nku.edu</a>) invites applications for multiple positions.  

Northern Kentucky University?s Board of Regents has invested in multiple new faculty positions in response to the success of the College of Informatics. The faculty positions are defined to help grow enrollment and improve student success in existing programs in technology (Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Data Science, Information Systems, Information Technology and Media Informatics) as well as develop and explore new programs in order to fill unmet needs in the technology sectors in Kentucky and greater Cincinnati. 

The department of Computer Science, housed in College of Informatics, is organizing searches for seven of these positions.  The focus of the search is for expertise, and new faculty will be affiliated with their appropriate departments. 

At most one position is at Associate level, four to six positions are at Assistant level, and one to two are Professor of Practice positions. The Assistant / Associate positions are tenure track positions while the Professor of Practice positions are non-tenured renewable positions.

For the Associate level position we seek candidates whose research area is cybersecurity and who are interested in teaching and developing cybersecurity courses at the bachelor?s and master?s levels.  

For the Assistant level positions we seek candidates with teaching and/or research expertise in one or more of the following areas: cybersecurity, data analytics, artificial intelligence, data visualization, user experience / front-end design, and computer science / information technology / cybersecurity education. Strong candidates with expertise in other areas of computer science and information technology are also encouraged to apply. Due to interdisciplinary component of some of the above areas (such as data visualization and user experience / front-end design) the selected applicants may have a joint appointment between Computer Science and a related department. Candidates with interdisciplinary interests from the above specified areas are strongly encouraged to apply. 

For the Professor of Practice positions we seek candidates that have teaching and/or industry experience in any area of information technology. 

Above all, Northern Kentucky University values quality teaching. In addition, tenure-track faculty members are expected to be active scholars.  The incorporation of students into research is especially valued.  For the Professor of Practice positions there are no research expectations. All faculty members are expected to provide service to the department, university or the community. This could include curriculum development at either the undergraduate or graduate level.
