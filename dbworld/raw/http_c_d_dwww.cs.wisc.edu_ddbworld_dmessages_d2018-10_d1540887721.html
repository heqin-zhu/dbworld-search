=====================================================================

Aim and Scope
=============
FQAS is the premier conference focusing on the key issue in the information society of providing easy, flexible, and intuitive access to information to everybody. In targeting this issue, the conference draws on several research areas, such as information retrieval, database management, data science, information filtering, knowledge representation, knowledge discovery, analytics, soft computing, management of multimedia information, and human-computer interaction. The guiding topic of the FQAS conferences are innovative query systems aimed at providing easy, flexible and human-friendly access to information. Such systems are becoming increasingly important also due to the huge and always growing number of users as well as the growing amount of available information. Thus, works related to the concepts of data science, data streams querying etc., are very welcome. This year, FQAS has a special theme: Flexible querying and analytics for smart cities and smart societies in the age of big data. This provides a unique opportunity to special focalize on emerging research trends that are leading the research scene since several years.

Since 1994, the conference has provided a unique and multidisciplinary forum for researchers, developers and practitioners to explore and exchange new ideas and approaches in all mentioned research areas. We invite submission of original research contributions, and proposals for invited sessions, panels, and tutorials. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following in the context of intelligent information access and/or flexible query answering systems, and seamlessly organized in three main topic containers:

Conference Location
=================
Hotel Village La Principessa, Amantea, Italy

Submission Guidelines and Instructions
================================
All accepted papers will be published by Springer-Verlag in their Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series. Authors are invited to submit original previously unpublished research papers written in English, of up to 12 pages, strictly following the LNCS/LNAI format guidelines. Authors can download the Latex (recommended) or Word templates available at Springer's web site. Submissions not following the format guidelines will be rejected without review. Submissions should be made electronically in PDF format via the electronic submission system of the FQAS 2019 Conference Management system. At least one author of each published paper must register for the conference and present the paper at the conference.

Paper Publication
===============
Accepted contributions will be published by Springer-Verlag LNAI series and they will be disseminated through the Springer Digital Library Springer Link. Papers will be also indexed by DBLP and Scopus. A selection of the best FQAS 2019 papers will be invited to be revised and extended for the post-conference publication in several special issues of top-quality journals.

Call for Special Sessions
====================
FQAS 2019 invites proposals for Special Sessions to be held during the conference. Special sessions complement the regular technical program by highlighting new and emerging research topics or innovative applications of established approaches. The topic of a special session proposal should be timely and compelling.

While we welcome special sessions in all areas of flexible query answering systems, we are particularly interested in focused research topics, specifically those related to the following innovation themes:

?	Big Data
?	Cognitive Computing
?	Deep Learning
?	Internet of Things
?	Personalized Healthcare Systems
?	Industry 4.0
?	Smart Systems

Special sessions can also cover any other area focusing on challenging open problems of relevance in applications.
The participation of speakers from industry in a special session proposal is encouraged and will be positively evaluated when the proposal is assessed.
Note that all papers will be subject to the same peer review process as for regular papers.
Proposal Submission. Please submit proposals (approximately 3 pages) in PDF format by email to the Special Sessions Co-Chairs. Proposal should include the following information:
?	Title and Abstract: Propose a title and a brief abstract of no more than approximately 100 words that will allow conference attendees to understand the topic and the focus of the special session.
?	Rationale: Please explain why the topic of the special session is novel and timely, why it is relevant to the FQAS community and how it possibly fits within the innovation themes listed above.
?	Proposed Speakers: Provide a list of all talks, speakers, and co-authors (in each associated paper). Technical sessions are normally expected to have 5 papers. In exceptional cases (like industrial talks, or contribution by particularly renowned speakers) it may be possible to have sessions of one talks without an associate paper or a talk which will have a double-time slot for the presentation. In these cases, please contact the Special Sessions Chairs in advance (before submitting your proposal) to explain the rationale of your request.
?	Biographies: Provide a short bio-sketch of the session proposers.

Important aspect in the evaluation of special session proposals will be the timeliness of the topic, quality/track record of the proposers and speakers, coherence of the session and expected value added to the overall technical program.
