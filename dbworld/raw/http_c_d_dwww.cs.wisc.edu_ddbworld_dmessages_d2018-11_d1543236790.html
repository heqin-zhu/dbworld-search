INTRODUCTION TO THE TRACK

Experience and volume of data are generated and used in risk and crisis management. Structuring this amount of data and learning from them are still big challenges to be faced to help actors either in decision-making or in operations. Otherwise, several techniques have been developed in the last century in Artificial Intelligence (AI) study and Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) that can be applied to face this challenge. The combination of these tools and methods continue to show promising results in improving sharing of information in crisis and emergency contexts.

There exist many approaches of Artificial Intelligence such as, decision trees, fuzzy logic and neural networks. Machine learning, in particular, is an approach that gives ¡°computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed¡± by learning and making predictions from data. Also, the use of AI and ontologies as a knowledge representation mechanism offers many advantages in information retrieval and analysis. In addition, semantic models of knowledge allow users as well as systems to clearly understand what is happening in a crisis situation and can provide support to decision makers.

This track mainly addresses the application of semantic models and Artificial intelligence methods and tools trying to answer to users' needs in the scope of risk and crisis management.
 

We welcome papers on topics including, but not limited to, the following:

- Analysis, prediction, planning, preparation, and response in crisis and emergency scenarios 
- Big data analytics and management in crisis management
- Communication and discussions analysis
- Communication infrastructures, technologies and services for crisis management
- Coordination, collaboration and decision support technologies and systems for crisis management
- Cooperative decision-making 
- Crisis and emergency knowledge engineering 
- Decision making under uncertainty
- Evacuation and rescue geo-planning
- Geo-Information technologies for crisis management
- Humanitarian logistics
- Interoperability in crisis management
- Knowledge map and visualization
- Knowledge graph
- Machine learning and deep learning applications for crisis management
- Meta-models for crisis
- Modeling and simulation tools for crisis and disaster situations
- Multi-agent systems for emergency simulation
- Ontologies for crisis and/or risk management
- Participatory activities in crisis management
- Prediction and early warning systems
- Process mining 
- Reasoning with uncertainty in crisis management
- Resilience engineering
- Risk, damage and loss assessment
- Rule and case based reasoning
- Querying and filtering on heterogeneous, multi-source streaming disaster data
- Semantic web

ISCRAM2019 invites two categories of papers:

CoRe: Completed Research (from 4000 to 8000 words). Submission open until December 1st, 2018. Go to the Conftool ISCRAM 2019 space (https://www.conftool.pro/iscram2019/index.php) to make your submission.

WiPe: Work In Progress (form 3000 to 6000 words). Submission currently closed. Will open in January 2019.

Please use the ISCRAM paper template (https://iscram2019.webs.upv.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ISCRAM2019_Conference_WiPeORCorePaperTemplate_v2.doc) for the preparation of your submission.

All articles will be evaluated according to the following process: once submitted to a specific track, articles will be distributed among the pool of reviewers according to their domain of expertise and the topics addressed by the article according to the ISCRAM submission framework. The selected papers will be organized in sessions, distributed among the tracks.

The proceedings will be published in the ISCRAM Digital Library (<a href="http://idl.iscram.org">http://idl.iscram.org</a>) as in the previous years. They will be indexed by DBLP, SCOPUS, and Compendex.
