  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I am looking for a PhD student to work with me on developing data integration techniques for NoSQL data sources. This will build on significant previous work I have done in the area of NoSQL database design.&nbsp;Any interested students should have background in database systems. (Having taken a previous database course or with other relevant experience.) More details about the program are given below. Interested students are encouraged to contact me directly (https://michael.mior.ca).

This use-inspired basic research degree is designed to produce independent scholars, well-prepared educators and cutting-edge researchers poised to excel in their professional careers within disciplinary, interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary environments in academia, government and industry. Although it is only in its 13th year of existence, it has already gained national high reputation, as evidenced from reputation-based US News ranking (68th in the country) and top-tier publication based CSRANKINGS.org ranking (66th in the country).

The Ph.D. Admissions Committee will review all completed applications submitted by January 15, 2019. After that date, applications will be reviewed on a space available basis. Decisions are expected to be made by April 15, 2019. In general, Fall Semester is the entry semester to begin study for the Ph.D. degree.
