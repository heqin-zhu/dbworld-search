Preamble
***************************************

Emoji2019 is a follow up to one of the best-attended workshops at ICWSM 2018 that was extended from a half-day to a full day due to the quality and quantity of submissions received and the expressed interest. Emoji2018, which was the previous workshop in this series involved a truly interdisciplinary (computer science, linguistics, computational social science, anthropology, law, and marketing) and highly engaging participation covering a balanced representation from academia and industry. It attracted 18 submissions, including 14 long papers and 4 short papers. A total of 8 papers (6 long papers and 2 short papers) were accepted for the final workshop program and the workshop proceedings are available online at <a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2130/">http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2130/</a>. The workshop program also included a keynote presentation, a tutorial, and a highly interdisciplinary panel on "The Challenges in Emoji Understanding" that provided an animated and engaging forum to the attendees to discuss the open emoji research problems with leading researchers and practitioners. The panel consisted of Jennifer 8. Lee (Vice Chair, Unicode Emoji Subcommittee), Keith Winstein (Assistant Professor, Stanford University), Eric Goldman (Professor, Santa Clara University), Rachael Tatman (Data Scientist, Kaggle), and Francesco Barbieri (Postdoctoral Researcher, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Spain). The workshop program was covered in a WIRED.com article by Arielle Pardes, which can be accessed online at https://www.wired.com/story/academic-emoji-conference/ Following the success of Emoji2018, we announce Emoji2019, the 2nd? International Workshop on Emoji Understanding and Applications in Social Media, co-located with The Web Conference 2018 (formerly WWW).

With the rise of social media, emoji have become an extremely popular form of communication in social media. They are equally popular across major social media sites including Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. As of 2017, Facebook and Facebook Messenger process over 60 million and 6 billion messages with emoji per day, respectively. In 2015, Instagram reported that nearly half of the photo comments posted on Instagram contains emoji and Instagram users tend to replace slang terms using emoji in photo comments. Another study revealed that emoji are slowly taking over emoticons on Twitter. Emoji data generated on social media sites have been utilized to study how emoji are used across different languages, cultures, user communities and as features to learn machine learning models to solve problems that span across many applications, including sentiment analysis, emotion analysis, and sarcasm detection. The ability to automatically process, derive meaning, and interpret text fused with emoji will be essential as society embraces emoji as a standard form of online communication. Thus, Emoji2019 tries to bring together computer and social science researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to discuss and exchange ideas on understanding social, cultural, communicative, and linguistic roles of emoji while leading the discussions on building novel computational methods to understand and interpret them.

Emoji2019 is focused on research and discussions on challenges in emoji understanding, including but not limited to the following research directions. We encourage contributions on the challenges in emoji understanding and on applications that add to the scientific understanding, including but not limited to the following research topics:

Challenges in interpreting the meaning of an emoji in a message context 
Novel methods for emoji sense disambiguation 
Novel methods for calculating emoji similarity 
Novel methods for emoji prediction 
Emoji-based retrieval and search 
Challenges in using emoji as a language 
Emoji¡¯s effects on the evolution of language constructs used on social media such as emoticons and slang terms 
Common emoji usages in social media 
Cultural and community-specific emoji meaning evolution and interpretation 
Distinct social and communicative roles of emoji 
Understanding sender intention and receiver interpretation of emoji 
Emoji rendering and interface design challenges 
Applications of emoji in social media 
Emoji and the Law 
Research related to other pictorial representations such as emoticons, kaomoji, emotes, customized emoji (e.g., bitmoji), and animated gifs

We encourage submissions that utilize quantitative, qualitative and mixed research methods to approach the above challenges as contributions. Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for this special issue. Submissions will be evaluated by the program committee based on the quality of the work and its fit to the special issue themes. All submissions should be double-blind and use the latest ACM templates available at https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions for formatting. A high-resolution PDF of the paper should be uploaded to the submission site at https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/tsc before the paper submission deadline. 


***************************************
Submission Guidelines
