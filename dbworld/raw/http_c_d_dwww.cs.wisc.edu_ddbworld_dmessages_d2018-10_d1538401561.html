Notes for Research Papers
--------------------------
Manuscripts must be prepared in accordance with the given submission guidelines. Research papers must not exceed 12 pages, including the bibliography and any appendix. Only electronic submissions in PDF format will be considered. Please upload your submission to the ICDE 2019 Research Track through the submission site (https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ICDE2019). Your submission must be made within the due date specified above.

A paper submitted to ICDE 2019 cannot be under review for any other conference or journal during the entire time it is considered for ICDE 2019, and it must be substantially different from any previously published work. Submissions are reviewed in a single-blind manner.

All accepted papers will appear in the proceedings. The best papers will be selected for extended versions to be published in the IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from IEEE Xplore) if none of the authors attends the conference to present their paper.


Conflicts of Interest
--------------------------
During submission of a research paper, the submission site will request information about conflicts of interest of the paper's authors with program committee (PC) members. It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only their potential conflict-of-interest PC members, according to the following definition:

A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when and only when one or more of the following conditions holds:
- The PC member is a co-author of the paper.
- The PC member has been a co-worker in the same company or university within the past two years.
- The PC member has been a collaborator within the past two years.
- The PC member is or was the author's primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago.
- The author is or was the PC member's primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago.
- The PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author.

Papers with incorrect or incomplete conflict of interest information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate rejection.
