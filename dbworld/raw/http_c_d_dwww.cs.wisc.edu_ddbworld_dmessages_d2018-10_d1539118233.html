--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              Saint Petersburg University, Saint Petersburg (Russia), July 1-4, 2019

                              <a href="http://www.iccsa.org">http://www.iccsa.org</a>

 
                          Call for Workshop proposals
                          ---------------------------

We encourage and invite interested parties to submit a proposal for organizing a Workshop during ICCSA 2019
===========================================================================================================

Workshop proposals will be collected and evaluated as they are received until October 30, 2018 and notification of acceptance / rejection will be sent before November 5, 2018.

The Workshop proposals should be submitted from the researcher's home page on the ICCSA 2019 Electronic Submission System (https://ess.iccsa.org). 
Researchers who have already collaborated with previous ICCSA Conference series are already defined to the system, the others have to register to the submission system in order to access it.

The form to be filled will require the following information:

 

1) Title of the Workshop

2) Name, the affiliation, mailing address and e-mail address of the Workshop organizer(s)

3) Previous experience of the organizer(s) in organizing Workshops (if any) 

4) Name, affiliation, and e-mail addresses of at least three colleagues of the organizer(s) who can comment on her/his (their) ability to organize the Workshop. The organization of successful workshops in previous editions of ICCSA (at least 5 papers accepted in the Proceedings, minimum no-show up, several discussions and questions during/after presentations), including the participation of the Workshop Organizers to the Conference, will be given priority ranking for acceptance.

5) Description of the topics of the workshop (not exceeding 100 words) and detailed list (name, affiliation, country) of the Program Committee members and additional reviewers (if external to the program committee)

6) The selected publisher (LNCS) of the proposed workshop. If you are interested publishing the papers of your Workshop on IEEE Xplore, please specify IEEE.

7) A short description on how the workshop will be advertised.

 

The information provided by the workshop organizer(s) to the Conference Chairs  shall remain strictly confidential.

The Workshop Organizers are responsible for all the organizational aspects including soliciting submissions and providing the details of an adequate number of reviewers for the Workshop papers.  Workshop Organizers are also fully responsible for ensuring that only high quality papers are accepted for publication in the Proceedings and for verifying the correctness of the layout adopted by the authors (which depends from the editor selected for the workshop). They are also responsible for choosing the actual reviewers (at least three) for each paper and for monitoring the reviewing process on the reviewing system, in collaboration with the Conference Program Chairs.

Workshop Organizers (or their Deputies) are expected to attend ICCSA 2019, set the order of presentations and chair their related workshop(s).

Due to their active role, Workshop Organizers will receive some incentives, depending on the number and quality of accepted and registered papers.

WARNINNG: FAKE ICCSA CONFERENCE BY WASET 
========================================

We have noticed the existence of organisations such as WASET that run fake ¡°conferences¡± in order to make profit with the registration fees, often spoofing the names of real conferences. WASET claims to be organising a conference called ICCSA next year, which is a FAKE ICCSA conference.  
The Real ICCSA conference has been organised by the ICCSA Society since 2003. We do not have any involvement with WASET. Please spread this news to your contacts and communities so that nobody mistakenly participates to such fake conferences.  
WASET is predator publisher. Go to this Wiki Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Academy_of_Science,_Engineering_and_Technology
