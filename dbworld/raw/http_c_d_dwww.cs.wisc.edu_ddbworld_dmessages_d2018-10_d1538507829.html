DESCRIPTION

Type error diagnosis addresses the problem of communicating to the programmers of statically typed languages why a given program is considered to be type incorrect and therefore cannot be compiled. Ultimately, the aim of the field is to increase the usability of compiler tools for statically typed languages. Traditionally, the field of type error diagnosis has centered on functional languages. However, we are explicitly looking for papers within the field irrespective of the programming language of programming paradigm, including but not restricted to imperative, object-oriented, functional, logical, and multi-paradigm languages. Papers may be of a fundamental and/or application-oriented nature. For example, they may discuss a general framework for implementing type error diagnosing techniques, study type error diagnosing facilities implemented in compilers, or report on a user study. Submitted papers should make a case why the paper should be of interest to anyone interested in type error diagnosis.

Authors are requested to submit their full revised version of papers to the Topical Issue complying the general scope of the journal. The submitted papers will undergo the standard peer-review process before they can be accepted. Notification of acceptance will be communicated as we progress with the review process.

HOW TO SUBMIT

Before submission authors should carefully read the Instruction for Authors: https://www.degruyter.com/view/supplement/s22991093_Instruction_for_Authors.pdf
