Please consider to send your contribution to:

Visual Pattern Extraction and Recognition for Cultural Heritage Understanding (VIPERC2019), a co-located workshop of 15th Italian Research Conference on Digital Libraries (IRCDL2019) 

Homepage: https://ircdl2019.isti.cnr.it/?page_id=537

The main goal of this workshop is presenting the advancement of the state-of-the-art in statistical and data mining tools, as well as the introduction of innovative and intelligent systems for visual pattern extraction, analysis and recognition aiming to preserve the cultural heritage. Hence, it combines multiple aspects deriving from different research areas such as Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering, Archaeometry and History. 

Topics to be discussed (but not limited to):

Pattern extraction and recognition in historical documents
Statistical methods for historical language recognition
Intelligent systems for art restoration
Archiving and searching methods for cultural heritage multimedia data
Information retrieval in cultural heritage images
Content-based image retrieval for cultural heritage
Feature extraction from cultural heritage multimedia data
Classification, similarity and segmentation of cultural heritage images
Augmented and virtual reality systems
3D reconstruction and model processing
Machine learning for document classification of cultural heritage
Graph-based methods for cultural heritage multimedia data
Nature-inspired algorithms for historical multimedia data
Deep learning applied to cultural heritage images, videos and documents
Hardware-based solutions for image analysis in cultural heritage
