  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">PVLDB REPRODUCIBILITY

Starting with VLDB 2018, PVLDB has joined SIGMOD in encouraging the data management community to develop a culture where sharing results, code, and scripts resulting from data management research is the norm rather than an exception. The challenge is to do this efficiently, which means building technical expertise on how to do better research via creating repeatable and sharable research. The PVLDB Reproducibility committee is here to help you with this. 

SUBMISSIONS
You can submit your paper accepted to PVLDB 2018 through CMT at: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/PVLDBRepro2018

You can find detailed information about PVLDB Reproducibility, in general, and about the submission process at https://vldb-repro.com. The reproducibility website includes the complete call, best practices, guidelines, links to tutorials and archived papers. Submissions will be accepted on a rolling, monthly basis throughout the year.  Any paper accepted to PVLDB in time to present at VLDB 2018 is eligible to participate on a voluntary basis. 

DATES
PVLDB Reproducibility uses a rolling, monthly deadline, as PVLDB itself.
Papers should be received by 5PM EST, on the first of each month to be considered for that month¡¯s review round.
Reproducibility reviews will be completed within 2 months.

WHY?
You will be making it easy for other researchers to compare with your work, to adopt, adapt, and extend your research. This instantly means more recognition for your work, higher impact, and greater chances for our community to solve big problems faster and reliably.  Successful papers will also be advertised at DBworld.

In addition, the official PVLDB Reproducibility website (<a href="http://vldb-repro.com">http://vldb-repro.com</a>) will maintain and advertise your papers, serving as a centralized location where researchers will be able to find all the experimentation material of sharable PVLDB papers. We will continue to enhance the functionality and material on this website to make it attractive and useful for the community, so stop by often!
