**********************************************************************

Big data processing is now widely employed in all aspects of our lives. Usually, parts or copies of a huge amount of data are stored in separate locations, and is infeasible to be collected and processed in a centralized manner, as it would be exceedingly inefficient to transfer them over the network. We therefore need new software foundations based on which big data can be efficiently analyzed and shared in a distributed way.

A highly relevant research area is bidirectional transformations, which provide a reliable mechanism for data synchronization. The study of bidirectional transformations originates from the long-standing problem of view updating in databases, and has led to a rich collection of bidirectional languages with new programming models tailored for data synchronization. Despite the potential in solving practical synchronization problems including data interoperability, bidirectional technologies are not widely employed yet, and most applications of bidirectional transformations remain only proof of concept.

This workshop aims at fostering discussion, exchange, and innovation in research and development in software foundations for data interoperability based on bidirectional transformation. Researchers and professionals from software, database, big data processing, and distributed and parallel processing are invited to share their knowledge and experience.

This workshop will provide a forum for the discussion of challenges and technical solutions to address software foundations for data interoperability based on bidirectional transformation. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Bidirectional Programming
- Big Data Integration
- Data Exchange
- Data Interroperability
- Data Provenance
- Data Synchronization
- Distributed Data Management
- Distributed Collaborative Systems
- Inverse Programming
- Large-scale data analysis
- P2P Data Sharing/Management
- Schema Mapping Technique
- Query Optimization
- Query Parallelization
