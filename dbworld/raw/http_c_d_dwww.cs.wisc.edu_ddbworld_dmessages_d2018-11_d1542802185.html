DESCRIPTION
The goal of RCIS is to bring together scientists, researchers, engineers and practitioners from a wide range of information science fields and provide opportunities for knowledge sharing and dissemination. RCIS has become a recognised conference on research challenges in information sciences. Organised for the 13th time in a row, RCIS 2019 will be held from May 29-31, 2019, in Brussels, Belgium, Capital of Europe.

TOPICS OF INTEREST
At RCIS 2019, among other regular topics, special attention will be given to the special topic: ?Towards a Design Science for Information Systems?. With the advent of ubiquitous computing, today?s information systems are designed, developed, used, and tested on a very wide spectrum of devices and computing platforms, by a diverse population of stakeholders (e.g., analysts, designers, developers, end users) for an ever wider range of tasks carried out in multiple physical and psychological environments, thus inducing many different contexts of use. Facing this variety of contexts of use, design science is expected to help people producing information systems that are better tailored to their needs when interacting with these systems. This year?s RCIS theme aims to explore the role played by design science in every stage of the development life cycle of information systems, which includes meta-models, models, languages, notations, methods, and software tools for supporting these stages. RCIS welcomes submissions from a diverse spectrum of information science. The list of themes and topics includes, but is not limited to, the following areas, themes and topics:
