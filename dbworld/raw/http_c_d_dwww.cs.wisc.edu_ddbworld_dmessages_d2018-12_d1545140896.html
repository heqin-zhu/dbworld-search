The Computer Science Education Research Conference (CSERC) is an
international forum for researchers with interests in educational aspects of
all computing disciplines including computer science, computer engineering,
software engineering, and information systems. It embraces a broad view of
the current and future trends in computing education and aspires to be a
lively environment for presenting the latest research and empirical results. 

Submissions to CSERC 2019 might cover, but are not limited to, the
following topics:
? Specific educational subject matter, such as programming,
   database systems, computer security, and modelling.
? Particular educational innovations, such as MOOCs, flipped-classroom,
   game-based education, and E-Learning.
? Specific groups of students, such as first years, women, masters students,
   minorities, impaired students.
? Broader topics, such as curriculum, group-work, assessment,
   class infrastructure.


Submissions 

Original and unpublished submissions in all areas related to computing
education are invited in the following categories:
? Research Paper: Reporting theoretical or theoretically-informed empirical
studies undertaken to investigate a specific aspect or address a particular
problem in computing education.
? Experience Report: Describing a classroom innovation and an evaluation
of its impact.
? Software Report: Describing developed tools for supporting teaching,
learning or assessment in computing education.

Types of accepted submissions include:
? Full Paper (approximately 12 pages).

Colocation with ISSEP 2019

CSERC?19 co-locates with the 12th International Conference on Informatics
in Schools: Situation, Evolution and Perspectives (ISSEP 2019). ISSEP is a
forum for researchers and practitioners in the area of Informatics education,
in both primary and secondary schools. It provides an opportunity for
educators to reflect upon the goals and objectives of this subject matter,
its curricula and various teaching/learning paradigms and topics, possible
connections to everyday life and various ways of developing Informatics
Education in schools. Combining CSERC and ISSEP provides a unique
opportunity for educational researchers and practitioners to get a broad
and comprehensive overview of educational research initiatives taking place
at primary and secondary schools as well as higher education.
