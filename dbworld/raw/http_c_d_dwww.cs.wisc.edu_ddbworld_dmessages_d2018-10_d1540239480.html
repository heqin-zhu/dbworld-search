IEEE BigData Congress/CLOUD/EDGE/ICCC/ICIOT/ICWS/SCC
July 8 - 13, 2019, Milan, Italy

The IEEE World Congress on Services (IEEE SERVICES 2019) will be held on July 8 - 13, 2019 at the Universita' degli Studi di Milano in Milan, Italy. The Congress will cover all aspects of services computing and applications, current or emerging. It covers various systems and networking research pertaining to cloud, edge and Internet-of-Things (IoT), as well as technologies for intelligent computing, learning, big data and blockchain applications, while addressing critical requirements such as high performance, security, privacy, dependability, trustworthiness, re-usability, interoperability, and cost-effectiveness. The Congress will be organized with seven affiliated, co-located conferences/congresses solely sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society under the auspice of the Technical Committee on Services Computing (TCSVC). Original manuscripts are invited to submit to these conferences/congresses considered with most suitable from the technical point of view.

*****PAPER REQUIREMENTS*****
Language: English
Paper size and format: US Letter; Two-column format in the IEEE style
Page limit: Up to eight pages for peer review for regular papers; Up to three pages for a "work in progress" paper
Abstract Length: 1500 characters for a regular paper, and 500 characters for "work in progress" papers
Number of Keywords: between five to eight keywords for each paper
File format: Limit the size of a single PDF file to be 6MB

Note: Authors of the accepted regular papers will have available up to 10 pages for the final version of papers.

Anonymous Submissions: All conferences implement a double-blind reviewing process. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should make a reasonable effort not to reveal their identities of institutional affiliations in the text, figures, photos, links, or other data that is contained in the paper. Authors' prior work should be preferably referred to in the third person; if this is not feasible, the references should be blinded. Submissions that violate these requirements will be rejected without review. The list of authors cannot be changed after the acceptance decision is made unless approved by the Program Chairs.

All submitted manuscripts will be peer-reviewed by the program committee. Accepted papers with confirmed registration and committed presentation will appear in the conference proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press. Each conference/congress will publicly announce the winners of its Best Paper Award, and Best Student Paper Award. The authors of selected papers will be encouraged to submit extended and enhanced versions of their papers to the IEEE Transactions on Services Computing (TSC) and other suitable journals.

Submitted Regular and Workshop Papers will be limited to 8 (IEEE Proceedings style) pages and REQUIRED to be formatted using the IEEE Proceedings template. Submitted Work-In-Progress Papers will be limited to 3 (IEEE Proceedings style) pages. Unformatted papers and papers beyond the page limit may not be reviewed.

Special note in regard to early submissions: Authors are invited to consider early submissions and only full/regular papers will be accepted. An early submitted paper which is accepted will be included in the proceedings. An early submitted paper which is rejected can be still revised and submitted to the normal submission deadline (whereas the normal papers cannot be resubmitted). If the authors of an early submitted paper which is rejected  decide to resubmit their paper to the normal deadline, they will have to include an appendix (2 pages) describing how they have addressed the comments received by the reviewers on the early submission.

*****IMPORTANT DATES*****
Regular Papers:
Early paper submissions due: December 1, 2018
Review comments to authors of early submission papers: January 15, 2019
Normal paper submission due: February 4, 2019
Final notification to authors: March 15, 2019
Camera ready manuscripts due: April 1, 2019
Congress dates: July 8-13, 2019

*****IEEE POLICY*****
Review Policy: IEEE Policy and professional ethics require that referees treat the contents of papers under review as privileged information not to be disclosed to others before publication. It is expected that no one with access to a paper under review will make any inappropriate use of the special knowledge, which that access provides. Contents of abstracts submitted to conference program committees should be regarded as privileged as well, and handled in the same manner. The Conference Publications Chair shall ensure that referees adhere to this practice.
Organizers of IEEE conferences are expected to provide an appropriate forum for the oral presentation and discussion of all accepted papers. An author, in offering a paper for presentation at an IEEE conference, or accepting an invitation to present a paper, is expected to be present at the meeting to deliver the paper. In the event that circumstances unknown at the time of submission of a paper preclude its presentation by an author, the program chair should be informed on time, and appropriate substitute arrangements should be made. In some cases it may help reduce no-shows for the Conference to require advance registration together with the submission of the final manuscript.
