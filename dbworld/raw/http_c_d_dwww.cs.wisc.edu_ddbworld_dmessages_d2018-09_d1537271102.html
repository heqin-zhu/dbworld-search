== IEEE BigComp 2019 ==

The 6th IEEE International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing

February 27 - March 2, 2019
Kyoto, Japan

Sponsored by IEEE and KIISE
<a href="http://www.bigcomputing.org/">http://www.bigcomputing.org/</a>

= Welcome =

Big data and smart computing are emerging research fields that have
recently drawn much attention from computer science and information
technology as well as from social sciences and other disciplines.

The goal of the International Conference on Big Data and Smart
Computing (BigComp), initiated by KIISE (Korean Institute of
Information Scientists and Engineers), is to provide an international
forum for exchanging ideas and information on current studies,
challenges, research results, system developments, and practical
experiences in these emerging fields.

Following the successes of the previous BigComp conferences in Bangkok,
Thailand (2014), Jeju, Korea (2015), Hong Kong, China (2016), Jeju, 
Korea (2017), and Shanghai, China (2018), the 2019 International 
Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing (BigComp 2019) will be held 
in Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.

The conference is co-sponsored by IEEE and KIISE. BigComp 2019 invites
authors to submit original research papers and original
work-in-progress reports on big data and smart computing.
