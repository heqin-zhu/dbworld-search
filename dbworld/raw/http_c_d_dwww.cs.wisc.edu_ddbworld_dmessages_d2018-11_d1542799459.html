 IJCNN 2019 Special Session
Organized by Marioluca Bernardi, Marta Cimitile, Francesco Mercaldo

The widespread diffusion of computational capabilities in a plethora of aspect of every-day life (for instance mobile devices, cars, smart houses, critical infrastructures, e-health), and the penetration of computers and software in enterprises of every dimension have led to an enormous number of victims of cyber attacks.


Malware writers are targeting not only end-users, but also companies and public services: the last trend is represented by the so-called ransomware that has reached epidemic proportions globally. Global ransomware damage cost exceeds $8 billion in 2018, up from $325 million in 2015. 


Research community in last years has provided several methodologies to detect threats, but the number of false positive is usually too high to consider their solutions in the real-world environment. In addition, scientific literature lacks of methods able to prevent zero-day attacks and to mitigate the consequences of infections.


Artificial Intelligence (AI) consists of a set of methodologies aimed realizing machine to mimic cognitive functions that humans associate with other human minds. 
Techniques exploiting AI have been successfully used in many real world applications on a wide spectrum of engineering problems. 
Looking at the security context, these approaches can also be used to protect the privacy and security of the users of information and communication systems and technologies. 
Such techniques can be useful for the verification and  mitigation of malicious threats in order and to thoroughly verify security properties. 
Topics of interest in this areas include: denial of service attacks, forensics, intrusion detection systems, homeland security, critical infrastructures protection, sensitive information leakage, access control and malware detection and tracking. 
Thus, AI offers the potential to develop secure systems . 
From these considerations, the objective of this special session is to encourage the integration between these cyber-security and AI communities towards the development of secure and resistant systems.






Topics of interest cover, but are not limited to, application of artificial intelligence techniques relating to:


* Intelligent analysis algorithm for Privacy or Security
