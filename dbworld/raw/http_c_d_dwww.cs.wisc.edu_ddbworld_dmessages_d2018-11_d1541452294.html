Special Issue on the Sensors, Observations, Actuators and the Web of Linked Data and Things
on Semantic Web Journal

* Important dates
Paper submission deadline: December 14 2018
Envisioned First round notification: February 2019

* Scope
The rapid advancement and ubiquitous penetration of mobile networks, Web-based information creation and sharing, and software-defined networking technology enable us to sense, predict and control the physical world using information technology¡ªon top of the resulting Internet of Things (IoT), business models and processes have been redesigned on the Web across a broad range of industries leading to the so-called Web of Things (WoT). To maximize its social and economic benefit, issues of interoperability, data and service mash-ups, the development of open platforms, and standardization on the application layer have to be addressed.
The capabilities of new networks of devices presents us with several new and complex challenges that need to be solved before data, device and service interoperability on the Web of Things can deliver their promised potential. Without connecting the data and its semantics that is generated by potentially billions of sensing, actuating and sampling devices, the users of the Web of Things will end up in silos of information that require different applications to access and use it. A description of the capabilities of these devices using semantic technologies may help in deciding how to communicate with the device and manage the data that is produced or the actions that can be performed. Besides the well researched area of cloud computing, new approaches such as edge computing and fog computing have been proposed to address parts of the scalability problem. The goal of these new approaches is to not transport all data but only relevant data across the Internet.
On the other hand, successfully interconnecting devices on the Web of Things will lead to a deluge of data that will present scalability problems to the data analysis and knowledge extraction and management. Further, issues around access to devices and privacy issues of what information can be shared in a highly interconnected Web of Things are also intensifying.

The focus of this special issue is to showcase novel approaches of applying semantic technologies to solve the problems of device and data integration. The topics of interest for the special issue include (but are not limited to):
* Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies for Web of Thing devices
* Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies for Web of Things¡¯ data
* Semantic technologies and Web of Things constraints and architectures
* Web of Things and Data applications and application development
* Semantic interoperability and standardization overcoming siloization of IoT systems
* Coupling between semantics and other AI techniques for the Web of Things and Data (deep learning, multi-agent systems, etc.)
* Trust, privacy, and security in the Web of Things and Data
* Experience in sensor network applications of semantic technologies
