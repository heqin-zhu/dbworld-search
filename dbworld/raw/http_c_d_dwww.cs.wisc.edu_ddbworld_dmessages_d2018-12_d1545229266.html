  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">18th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2019)
?knowledge graphs, linked data, linked schemas and AI on the Web?
Auckland, New Zealand, 26-30 October, 2019
https://iswc2019.semanticweb.org/ 

The International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC) is the premier venue for presenting fundamental research, innovative technology, and applications concerning semantics, data, and the Web. It is the most important international venue to discuss and present latest advances and applications of the semantic Web, knowledge graphs, linked data, ontologies and artificial intelligence (AI) on the Web.

ISWC attracts a large number of high quality submissions every year and participants from both industry and academia. ISWC brings together researchers from different areas, such as artificial intelligence, databases, natural language processing, information systems, human computer interaction, information retrieval, web science, etc., who investigate, develop and use novel methods and technologies for accessing, interpreting and using information on the Web in a more effective way.

Become part of ISWC 2019 by submitting to the following tracks &amp; activities or just attend them!
(All deadlines are midnight Hawaii time.)


In this announcement:
1. Call for Workshops
2. Call for Tutorials
3. Call for Semantic Web Challenges


1. Call for Workshops
*******************************************

Besides the main technical program, ISWC will host several workshops on topics related to the general theme of the conference. The role of the workshops is to provide a setting for focused, intensive scientific exchange among researchers and practitioners interested in a specific topic. As such, workshops are the primary venues for the exploration of emerging ideas as well as for the discussion of novel aspects of established research topics.

We invite you to submit a proposal for workshops on a research topic of interest to ISWC attendees.

2. Call for Tutorials
*******************************************

In addition to the regular research and workshop program, ISWC 2019 will feature a tutorial program addressing the diverse interests of its audience: Semantic Web practitioners that wish to learn about new technologies, novices to the Semantic Web interested in introductory tutorials to key Semantic Web / Linked Data topics, government and industry representatives focusing on the applicability of Semantic Web / Linked Data technologies in practical settings.

We hereby invite you to submit a tutorial proposal on a research topic relevant to the ISWC 2019 audience.

3. Call for Semantic Web Challenges
*******************************************
ISWC 2019 will run multiple Challenges (SWCs) with the aim to evaluate and compare software solutions for the Semantic Web in a systematic way. Each SWC will:
 * Define a task to be addressed,
 * Provide a training and a test dataset and
 * Define evaluation measures to compare the performance of participating systems.

The organizers of each SWC will be responsible for the selection of the participants who will be invited to present their solutions at ISWC 2019.

For ISWC 2019, SWC proposals are invited for any challenge involving Semantic Web tasks, including but not limited to:
 * Ontology alignment
 * Fact checking
 * Sentiment and Emotion analysis
 * Entity resolution
 * Link prediction
 * Attribute prediction and validation
 * Query and reasoning scalability
 * Energy efficiency of computation (e.g. green processing)
 * Stream processing

Selected SWC systems will be presented at ISWC 2019 on October 30, 2019.
