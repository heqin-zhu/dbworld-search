27th ACM International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation
and Personalization (ACM UMAP 2019)

Golden Bay Beach Hotel 5*, Larnaca, Cyprus, June 9-12, 2019

https://www.um.org/umap2019/


Abstracts due:  January 25, 2019 (mandatory)
Papers due:     February 1, 2019



BACKGROUND AND SCOPE

ACM UMAP, "User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization", is the premier
international conference for researchers and practitioners working on
systems that adapt to individual users, to groups of users, and that collect,
represent, and model user information. ACM UMAP is sponsored by ACM
SIGCHI and SIGWEB. The proceedings are published by ACM and will be part
of the ACM Digital Library.

ACM UMAP covers a wide variety of research areas where personalization
and adaptation may be applied. This include (but is in no way limited to) a
number of domains in which researchers are engendering significant
innovations based on advances in user modeling and adaptation,
recommender systems, adaptive educational systems, intelligent user
interfaces, e-commerce, advertising, digital humanities, social networks,
personalized health, entertainment, and many more. 

This year the conference hosts three new tracks, one on privacy and
fairness, one on personalized music access, and one on personalized health.


CONFERENCE TRACKS

For details, see the conference website ( https://www.um.org/umap2019/ ).

? Track 1 - Personalized Recommender Systems

? Track 2 - Adaptive Hypermedia and the Semantic Web

? Track 3 - Intelligent User Interfaces

? Track 4 - Personalized Social Web

? Track 5 - Technology-Enhanced Adaptive Learning

? Track 6 - Privacy and Fairness

SUBMISSION AND REVIEW PROCESS

Papers have to be submitted through EasyChair: 

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=acmumap2019

Long (8 pages + references) and Short (4 pages + references) papers in ACM
style, peer reviewed, original, and principled research papers addressing
both the theory and practice of UMAP and papers showcasing innovative
use of UMAP and exploring the benefits and challenges of applying UMAP
technology in real-life applications and contexts are welcome.

Long papers should present original reports of substantive new research
techniques, findings, and applications of UMAP. They should place the work
within the field and clearly indicate innovative aspects. Research procedures
and technical methods should be presented in sufficient detail to ensure
scrutiny and reproducibility. Results should be clearly communicated and
implications of the contributions/findings for UMAP and beyond should be
explicitly discussed.

Short papers should present original and highly promising research or
applications. Merit will be assessed in terms of originality and importance
rather than maturity, extensive technical validation, and user studies.

Papers must be formatted using the ACM SIG Standard (SIGCONF) proceedings
template: https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template .

All accepted papers will be published by ACM and will be available via the
ACM Digital Library. At least one author of each accepted paper must register
for the conference and present the paper there.
