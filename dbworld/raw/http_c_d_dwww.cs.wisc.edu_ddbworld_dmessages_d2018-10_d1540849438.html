Job Description?

The Department of Computer Science at the Missouri University of Science and Technology (Missouri S&amp;T) in Rolla, Missouri is seeking outstanding applicants for multiple open-rank tenure-track/tenured (TT) faculty positions in all areas of Computer Science. Preference will be given to applicants who can contribute to the department's areas of strength such as cyber-physical systems, cyber security, data science, and artificial intelligence. Competitive salary commensurate with the rank and qualifications of the candidates will be offered.?

Successful candidates will be expected to have strong commitments to (a) contributing to the departmental and college research efforts, (b) high-quality teaching both at the undergraduate and graduate levels, (c) service in the applicant's professional community and our institution, and (d) increasing the diversity of both the student body and faculty. Applicants should have demonstrated excellence in research and evidence of potential for excellence in external funding, high-quality teaching, service, and increasing diversity. Additionally, senior candidates should have demonstrated excellence in external funding and high-quality teaching. Applicants must hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science or a closely related field by the appointment start date. Candidates from national labs or industry with a strong research record coupled with academic experience are encouraged to apply as well.?

Missouri S&amp;T's Department of Computer Science has a proud 50+ year history of positively impacting society through ground-breaking research, and advancing the quality and breadth of its educational mission, granting an ABET-accredited BS, as well as MS and PhD degrees. An active recruitment strategy has resulted in the department now being one of the largest on campus, with over 800 students. Special emphasis on recruiting students from under-represented groups has been highly successful: for instance, the number of female students has grown significantly over the last five years. Research expenditures have grown about 37% from 2014 to 2017, with a wide variety of federal and industrial sponsors. The department has 4,383 successful and engaged alumni, and is strongly supported by the Academy of Computer Science, a 40-member organization dedicated to developing key programs of the department with financial support, and active engagement and advocacy. The department also has an active Industrial Advisory Board that provides feedback to ensure the curriculum remains relevant to industry and that our graduates have the capability to apply CS principles in innovative ways, and to provide financial support. The department is particularly proud that nearly a thousand recruiters sought Computer Science graduates last academic year, including multiple national labs with whom we have long-established hiring pipelines as well as funded research collaborations.?

Further details on required and desired attributes, skills and characteristics of the successful candidate, and the department's visions and strategic plan, activities, and research may be found at:?<a href="http://cs.mst.edu/.?">http://cs.mst.edu/.?</a>
