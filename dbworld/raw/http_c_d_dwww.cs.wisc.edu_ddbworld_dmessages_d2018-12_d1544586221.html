JCST Special Section on 
Spatio-Temporal Big Data Analytics

Aims and Scope 

The fast development of mobile Internet has given rise to an extremely large volume of spatio-temporal data. These data contain rich information of both individuals and groups, and are thus invaluable for traffic control, route planning, urban planning and many other intelligent applications. Although spatial data management research has made significant advances over the past decade, new solutions are needed to support effective spatio-temporal big data management, including: spatio-temporal database techniques, concerning the efficient and effective storage of trajectory data and query processing; spatio-temporal data quality management, which handles issues such as high redundancy, low precision, incompleteness and variety of data formats of spatio-temporal data; spatio-temporal data mining techniques, by which useful knowledge and patterns can be extracted from the spatio-temporal big data. This special section aims to address these new challenges to enable effective knowledge discovery from the spatio-temporal big data. 

This special section of JCST journal papers will focus on technologies and solutions related, but not limited to: 
*         Parallel and distributed processing for spatio-temporal big data; 
*         Data stream processing for spatio-temporal data; 
*         Data quality management for spatio-temporal big data; 
*         Spatial Crowd-sourcing and crowd-sensing; 
*         Indexing, optimisation and query processing for outdoor and indoor spatial data; 
*         Spatio-temporal prediction and inference; 
*         Spatio-temporal data analytics and mining methodologies; 
*         Spatial and temporal related recommendation systems; 
*         Innovative applications driven by spatio-temporal data. 
Besides original research papers, we also strongly encourage high-quality survey papers, systems papers and applications papers.
