People-driven Internet for Smarter Hyper-Connected Societies


The rise of wearable/embodied technologies and personal/body area networks has successfully bridged our personal physical and cyber worlds in recent years. Internet of People (IoP) represents the mapping of social individuals and their interactions with smart devices to the Internet. It focuses on data collection, modelling, and ubiquitous intelligence for a wide range of applications of crowd sourced, Internet-based personal information. Likewise, the emerging social and sentiment analysis computing, behaviour modelling and novel human/environment interaction mechanisms, e.g. brain, audible or augmented reality computing, will allow further incorporation of the social and mental worlds into the so-called Hyper World. Due to the pervasiveness of IoP and its impacts on human activity, it has quickly emerged as an important interdisciplinary field which encompasses IoT, HCI, bio-inspired algorithms with behavioral and social sciences. Hence, a Smart World is only possible if there is a better and smarter collaboration between devices and people, where technology is applied from a human-centric and driven standpoint, i.e. following the Internet of People paradigm. 
 
The 5th IEEE International Conference on Internet of People (IoP 2019) is a premier forum for sharing theoretical, experimental and operational results in related fields. The first IoP was held in 2015 at Beijing, China and was a great success. The subsequent IoP 2016, IoP 2017, and IoP 2018 were also successfully held in Toulouse, France, San Francisco Bay Area, USA, and Guangzhou, China. We welcome original papers presenting the latest research findings and applications on a wide range of IoP topics.

IoP 2019 topics include but are not limited to the following: 
- Social Computing and Social Internet of Things
- Social Networks of People and Devices
- Behaviour Change Analysis
- Internet of Sensing, Thinking and Creation
- Gamification and user-engagement approaches
