The World Congress on Sustainable Technologies (WCST-2018) is a multidisciplinary congress, bridging efforts across the natural, social and engineering sciences, the environment and development of communities. The congress covers a wide spectrum of topics that relate to sustainability, which includes technical and non-technical research areas. It also encourages sharing new knowledge in the field of sustainable technologies and the environmental impacts.

The mission of WCST-2018 is to provide the opportunities for collaboration and reflection that have the potential to greatly enhance the infrastructure and capacity for conducting and applying art, science and technology for sustainability.
