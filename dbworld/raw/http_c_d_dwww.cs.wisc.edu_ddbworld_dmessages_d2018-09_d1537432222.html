  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">(IEEE BIBM/CBPBL 2018) WORKSHOP on Computer Based Processes and Algorithms for Biomedicine and Life Quality Improvement (CBPBL 2018)

https://sites.google.com/view/cbpbl2018/home

In conjunction with BIBM 2018 <a href="http://orienta.ugr.es/bibm2018/">http://orienta.ugr.es/bibm2018/</a>

Welcome to the second edition of the Workshop on Computer based processes and algorithms for biomedicine and life quality improvement (CBPBL)

Organizer: Pierangelo Veltri, University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro
Clinical and biological data represent a huge information source for disease studies as well as for the improvement of wellness. For instance, studying electronic medical records (EMRs) may help researchers in extracting information spanning from data crawled from biological laboratories to textual description of diseases and diagnostic device results (e.g., biomedical images). Diagnosis records associated with citizens cured in hospitals can be used for administrative processes (e.g., costs, reimbursement) as well as disease monitoring. Proteins and genes data can be used to relate (risk of) diseases to familiar as well as environmental information (e.g., Genome-Wide Association Studies), allowing integrating clinical, genomics, environmental data to increase life quality. The workshop aims to attract people working in computer science and computer engineering area to present research topic related to the study of wellness improving. It aims to let authors working in area related to medicine to converge in a unique track to discuss and highline the importance of automatic process for life quality improvements via prevention and information extraction and/or enrichment.

TOPICS OF INTEREST
The workshop is seeking original research papers presenting applications of algorithms and solutions applied to biomedicine, clinical applications and lifestyle. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Data modeling and management for health related information.
- Large scale biological and biomedical databases
- Ontologies and dictionary for biomedical data  integration
- Mobile and personal device based algorithms and solutions for life style
- Algorithms for health informatics
- Prediction and inference models for biological and health related information
- Scientific workflows and process management in health informatics 
- High performance solutions for  bioinformatics and biomedicine
- Architectures  for bioinformatics and biomedicine
- Clinical and biological signals management
- Epidemiological models and systems for life quality monitoring
