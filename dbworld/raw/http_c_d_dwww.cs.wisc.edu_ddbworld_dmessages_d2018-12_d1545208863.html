PUBLICATION OF ADBIS PAPERS

Full papers
Full papers will be published in the Special issue of the journal Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Springer). Acceptance for publication in the journal is subject to peer review. Papers should be 12-15+ pages long in the LNCS format. For camera-ready papers use Latex or Word style (find here: <a href="http://preview.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">http://preview.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>).
The program committee may decide to accept a submission as a short paper if it reports interesting results but does not justify the publication of a full paper.

Short papers
Accepted short papers of the main conference will be published in Communications in Computer and Information Science (Springer) series. Acceptance for publication in the journal is subject to peer review. ADBIS short research papers should be 6-8+ pages long in the CCIS format. The best paper authored solely by students will receive an award.
Accepted workshop papers, doctoral consortium papers are also published in Springer¡¯s Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS) series. For camera-ready papers use Latex or Word style (find here: <a href="http://preview.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">http://preview.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>).

Further publication options
ADBIS 2019 organizing committee is negotiating with different journals for the best papers to be invited to be published in an extended format in a peer-reviewed special issue of the journal.
