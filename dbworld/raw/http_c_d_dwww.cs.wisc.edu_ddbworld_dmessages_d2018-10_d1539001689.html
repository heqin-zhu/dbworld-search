  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Call for ICDM Tao Li Award

ICDM Tao Li Award was established in December 2017. The purpose of the award is to honor Professor Tao Li?s life and accomplishment, and reward excellent early career researchers (individuals either in a doctoral program or who have received a doctoral degree less than 10 years prior to receiving the Award) in the field of data mining and machine learning.

The award, worth $2,000 in check, for one awardee, will be given out once a year at the annual IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM). The Tao Li Award was established through public donations, and is managed by the IEEE ICDM steering committee and the FAU Foundation.
