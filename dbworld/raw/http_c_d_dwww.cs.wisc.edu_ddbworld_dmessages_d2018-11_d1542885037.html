ABSTRACT:
Ambient intelligence technologies include the sensors, procedures, and systems used to create smart environments that respond intelligently to the presence of people. Examples of ambient intelligence environments include smart homes (e.g., smart security systems, health care monitoring, adaptive heating and air conditioning systems, personalized entertainment), smart cities (e.g., wireless sensor networks, adaptive traffic control, personalized transport services), or intelligent vehicles (e.g., adaptive speed adjustment, traffic analysis, pedestrian detection). Recently, the introduction of miniaturized instrumentation (e.g., invisible temperature sensors, vision-based systems in vehicles), small and general-purpose computing architectures (e.g., Raspberry PI), advanced communication networks (IoT-enabled home appliances, Bluetooth low-energy), and non-intrusive measurement procedures (e.g., touchless sensing, wearable devices, biometrics on-the-move) has fostered the research and development of innovative ambient intelligence environments able to sense, communicate, and respond intelligently and transparently to the presence of different people.

This special session presents an opportunity to the scientific and professional communities working in the field to introduce and discuss recent advances in instrumentation and measurement systems in ambient intelligence applications. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Smart homes
- Smart cities
- Smart cars
- Environmental monitoring
- Touchless measurement systems
- Virtual sensors
- Wearable sensors
- Health measurement
- Low-power devices
- Mobile sensors
- Non-invasive acquisition
- Less-constrained biometric recognition
- Speech and speaker recognition
- Age estimation
- Smart interfaces
- Soft biometrics
- Human tracking
- Context-aware biometrics
- Partial biometric recognition
- Sensor fusion
- Adaptive systems
- Computational intelligence for ambient intelligence
- Deep Learning for ambient intelligence
