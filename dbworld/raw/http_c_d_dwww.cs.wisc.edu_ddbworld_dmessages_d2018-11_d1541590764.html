===================================
Overview
===================================
"PlatCon-19 covers all Computer Science and ICT areas with their convergence topics."
PlatCon-19 will be the third event of the PlatCon conference series, which is hosted and organized by the ICRP(Institution of Creative Research Professionals), 
and this year event is technically cosponsored by IEEE Kwangju section(Conference Application in Progress). 
This conference will be one of most comprehensive conferences in the field of Platform Technology (PT). The focus of PlatCon-19 is various PT research issues, but also its coverage can be extended to a wide spectrum of topics related to Computer Science and ICT platforms and their service domains. And PlatCon-18 would be a professional and informative forum for scientists, engineers, experts, professors, and students in the areas of Computer Science, Information Technology, Computing Technology, Communication &amp; Network, HCI, Business &amp; Management, Intelligent System, Cyber security, Industrial Security, Cyber Physical System, Education Technology, IT-based convergence research fields, and also in multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary research fields of them.

During the last decade, many countries have adopted in recent years roadmap for developing the future infrastructure in emerging platform technology areas such as automobile, big data processing technology, biotechnology, nanotechnology, grid computing and ICT (Information and Communication Technology). Our special interest lies in both theoretical and practical research contributions presenting new techniques, concepts, or analysis, reports on experiences and experiments of implementation and application of theories, and tutorials on new technologies and trends in various platforms/services areas and in all relevant scientific/engineering areas.
The PlatCon-19 is the next event, in a series of highly successful International Conference on Platform Technology and Service, previously held as PlatCon 2018 (Jeju, Jan, 2018),  PlatCon 2017 (Busan, Korea, Feb. 2017), PlatCon 2016 (Jeju, Korea, Feb. 2016), PlatCon 2015 (Jeju, Korea, Jan. 2015), and PlatCon 2014 (Jeju, Korea, Feb. 2014).
