  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">CAiSE 2019 Call for Workshop Proposals
31st International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering
June 3-7, Rome, Italy
https://www.caise19.it 

CAiSE is a well-established highly visible conference series on Advanced Information Systems Engineering. It covers all relevant topics of information systems (IS) engineering such as methodologies and approaches for IS engineering, innovative platforms, architectures and technologies, and engineering of specific kinds of IS. CAiSE conferences also have the tradition of hosting several workshops in its area. Workshops are intended to focus on particular topics and provide ample room for discussion of new ideas and developments.

CAiSE 2019, the 31st edition of the CAiSE series, invites proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction with the conference, related to the CAiSE topics, covering new emerging topics and targeting ground-breaking papers in a special focus area. 

The workshop organizers are encouraged to focus their events on topics that are not already explicitly addressed by the two co-located working conferences BPMDS (<a href="http://www.bpmds.org">http://www.bpmds.org</a>) and EMMSAD (<a href="http://www.emmsad.org">http://www.emmsad.org</a>). 

Two kinds of workshops are invited:

* Presentation-oriented workshops: These will concentrate on presentations of accepted papers and discussion about these papers. The proceedings of these workshops are intended to be published as one volume in the Springer LNBIP series. According to Springer standards, the acceptance rate of full papers (12 pages) should not exceed 45%-50%. Some of the contributions might be accepted as short papers (6 pages) and they will appear in a designated section of the proceedings. However, the overall acceptance rate should not be higher than 45%-50%.
* Discussion-oriented workshops: These will emphasize discussions facilitated by paper presentations. Since the main criterion for paper acceptance in such workshops is relevance and potential for raising discussion, they are not expected to have their proceedings in the Springer LNBIP volume. The workshop organizers are expected to manage their own proceedings (e.g., using the CEUR series).

Workshop proposals should be submitted to Henderik A. Proper (e.proper@acm.org) and Janis Stirna (js@dsv.su.se). Prior contact with the workshop chairs is encouraged.

The organizer(s) of approved workshops will be responsible for advertising their workshop, for eliciting high quality submissions, for the reviewing process of their workshop's papers according to the principles and guidelines of the CAiSE organizers, and for the collection of camera-ready copies of accepted papers (verifying that they comply with the formatting rules).

Organizers (including co-organizers) are expected to attend their entire workshop, and to provide a summary of the event to the CAiSE organisers.

Important dates:
1 November 2018	Deadline for submission of workshops proposals (via email)
30 November 2018	Notification of workshop acceptance
15 March 2019	Camera ready of all papers and summary by workshop chairs
3-4 June 2019 	Workshops

Detailed instructions for workshop proposers
The proposal (length up to 1000 words) should cover the following points:

1. Workshop title, duration (1 day or 2 days), preferred date (June 3 and/or 4), workshop type (presentation-oriented or discussion-oriented).
2. The organizers (PC chairs, other organizers who will be present at the workshop or are otherwise involved, including the person responsible for web presence and communication). Please include names, addresses, affiliations, and indicate the main responsible person. The submission should include a one-paragraph biographical sketch for each organizer, describing relevant qualifications and experience.
3. Purpose: What are the main goals of the workshop? Please list the workshop topics. How does the focus of the workshop differ from the main conference? How does the focus of the workshop differ from other potential CAiSE events (you are advised to look at the workshops and working conferences held at CAiSE 2017 and CAiSE 2018 and differentiate your scope from theirs)? 
4. Organization of the workshop: Specify the type of contributions, distribution into sessions, type of sessions, etc. Mention if you plan to have any keynote speaker (please note that the conference organization will not cover fees, travel expenses, accommodation and registration cost). Include any special requirement regarding infrastructure and room layout. In particular, specify the proceedings type. For presentation-oriented workshops LNBIP will be the default option. For discussion-oriented workshops, specify how you will publish the contributions and how you plan to make them available to attendees (especially if you plan to require some support from the conference organization).
5. Tentative list of PC members.
6. An estimate of the number of papers to be accepted, and the number of attendees. If applicable, short information on previous editions of the workshop series (this should include submission, acceptance, and attendance information).
7. Short information on your plans for publicizing your workshop and making it highly visible.

Services provided by CAiSE
1. EasyChair installation for the management of the workshop submissions (each organizer will be made chair of its own workshop)
2. Publication of contributions in LNBIP volume for presentation-oriented workshops.
3. One free workshop-only-registration if more than 15 people are registered for the workshop. Organizers willing to attend the whole event (main conference), will have to register to the conference at their own expenses.
4. Local organizational infrastructure and administrative support (registration, badges, refreshments, beamers, screens, etc.). In particular all accommodation issues (rooms, meals and catering, social dinner, etc.) as well as the management of the registrations and the financing/administrative issues will be handled by the CAiSE Organization Board and are not under the responsibility of the workshop organizers
5. Advertisement of the workshop on CAISE 2019 homepage and mailings.

Please note that the workshop may be cancelled if the number of registrations is less than 10. Also, in case of workshops with topics that are close, two or more workshops or working conferences may be suggested to merge.
