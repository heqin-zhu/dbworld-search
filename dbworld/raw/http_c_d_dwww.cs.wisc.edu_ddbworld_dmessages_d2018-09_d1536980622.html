The Australasian Computer Science Week (ACSW) is the premier event for Computer Science researchers in Australasia that is organised by the Computing Research and Education (CORE) Association of Australasia.

ACSW consists of several conferences covering a wide range of topics in Computer Science and related area. This conference is attended by many national and international delegates comprising HDR students and distinguished academics from all over the world in computer science. The conference week has been running in some form continuously since 1978. This makes it one of the longest running conferences in Computer Science.

Authors are invited to submit papers that present original and unpublished research on topics directly to the relevant conference.

As with previous years, registration for ACSW will enable delegates to attend sessions in any conference participating or co-located in the Australasian Computer Science Week.
