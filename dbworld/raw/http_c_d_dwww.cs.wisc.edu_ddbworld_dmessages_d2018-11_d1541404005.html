                              CALL FOR PAPERS

  Trends and Advances in Ambient Intelligence for the Internet of Things

                         Special Issue of Sensors

           Guest Editors: N. Bassiliades, A. Bikakis, D. Vrakas
===========================================================================

Owing mainly to the recent advances in wireless communication and embedded
computing technologies, billions of devices, from tiny wireless sensors to
powerful data centre nodes, are now connected to each other over the
Internet, forming what is known as the Internet of Things (IoT). At the
same time, ambient intelligence (AmI), a new paradigm of human?computer
interaction, powered by the developments in artificial intelligence,
promises to transform our living environments into intelligent spaces that
will support us in our everyday tasks and activities in an adaptive,
seamless and unobtrusive fashion. Leveraging the enhanced connectivity of
the Internet of Things and the growing capabilities of ambient intelligence
technologies will lead to the development of a new generation of more
advanced and larger-scale solutions for several application domains such as
healthcare, education, culture, transportation, energy management,
emergency services and others.

In order to maximize the benefits that the technology has to offer, one has
to tailor ambient intelligence methodologies, systems and techniques in a
way that realizes the notion of ?from data to intelligent action?. Data
from IoT sensors need to be analysed in an intelligent way, enabling
reasoning about goals and actions to be efficiently communicated to the IoT
actuators in a resilient and versatile scheme that realizes the smart
environment vision.

The aim of this Special Issue is to present the latest trends, research
solutions, developments and applications that combine methods, techniques
and technologies from the Internet of Things and ambient intelligence,
demonstrating the potential of combining these two lines of research.

journal, are solicited in relevant areas including (but not limited to) the
following Ambient Intelligence methods applied to IoT, including methods for:

- activity recognition
- ambient agent architectures
- context-aware learning
- context-aware reasoning
- context-aware planning
- context-aware recommendation
- contextual modelling
- multimodal data analysis
- non-invasive/seamless interaction
- privacy/security/trust management

Submission Guidelines
=======================

Manuscripts should be submitted online at www.mdpi.com by registering and
logging in to the website. Once you are registered, submit through the
submission form at https://www.mdpi.com/user/manuscripts/upload/?journal=sensors. 
Manuscripts can be submitted until the deadline. All papers will be peer-
reviewed. Accepted papers will be published continuously in the journal (as
soon as accepted) and will be listed together on the special issue website.
Research articles, review articles as well as short communications are
invited. For planned papers, a title and short abstract (about 100 words)
can be sent to the Editorial Office for announcement on this website.

Submitted manuscripts should not have been published previously, nor be
under consideration for publication elsewhere (except conference
proceedings papers). All manuscripts are thoroughly refereed through a
single-blind peer-review process. A guide for authors and other relevant
information for submission of manuscripts is available on the Instructions
for Authors page (https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/instructions).
Sensors is an international peer-reviewed open access monthly journal
published by MDPI.

Please visit the Instructions for Authors page before submitting a
manuscript. The Article Processing Charge (APC) for publication in this
open access journal is 1800 CHF (Swiss Francs). Submitted papers should be
well formatted and use good English. Authors may use MDPI's English editing
service prior to publication or during author revisions.
