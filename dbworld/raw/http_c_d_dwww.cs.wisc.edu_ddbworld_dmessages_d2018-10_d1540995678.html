Trends and Applications of Text Summarization Techniques
A book edited by Alessandro Fiori, PhD (Institute for Cancer Research and Treatment (IRCCS))


To be published: https://goo.gl/vRG59J

Introduction
In the information age, the availability of electronic documents grows exponentially every day, while the time spent by the final users to process the information decreases. Moreover, the text documents represent a powerful resource of knowledge. For instance, by analyzing the document content, it is possible to extract user interests, communities' opinions, and expand the knowledge about a specific domain topic. Extracting a succinct and informative description of document collections by means of summarization techniques is fundamental to allow users to quickly familiarize themselves with the information of interest. Document summarization can simplify an information search and reduce the time to manage and analyze original documents.

Objective of the Book
This book aims at providing a comprehensive discussion of the state of the art in document summarization. The book will provide an in-depth examination of the approaches focused on update, multi-lingual and domain oriented summarization tasks. Furthermore, an exploration of current real-world applications in several fields, such as business intelligence, biological and genomics research and counter-terrorism activities will be also provided. Finally, the book also aims to initiating venues for future research in this field.

Target Audience
The target audience includes students, lecturers, researchers, and practitioners of information technology, computer science, bioinformatics, sciences, and business.  Developers and consumers will be interested in discovering how the document summarization can improve their productivity in real applications, while researchers and students can learn more about the main concepts of the state-of-art document summarization approaches. This book can also make an academic reference work by providing comprehensive coverage of the document summarization field. Through predictions of future trends, examinations of techniques and technologies, and focuses on real application scenarios, it book will be a useful instrument for developing new document summarization instruments for different application fields.
