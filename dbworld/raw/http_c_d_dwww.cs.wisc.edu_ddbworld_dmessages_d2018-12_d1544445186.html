  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Dear all,
Apologies for multiple receptions.

Below you will find the description of a CIFRE PhD thesis position with AdWanted
CIFRE thesis proposal

Institutions: AdWanted / University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne (CReSTIC)

Main place of work: France: Paris (75) or Reims (51)

Type of funding: CIFRE

Key words: Data science, recommendation systems, machine learning, artificial intelligence, big data, advertising/media plan.

Adwanted is an international company that specializes in the purchase of off-line media (press, radio, TV, ...) online in France, United States and Spain. It offers a web platform that contains inventories for sale and all tools needed to build a media plan and buy it. In addition, Adwanted has peripheral, platform-connected tools for media planning, performance analysis of a media plan, or financial reports that compile and disaggregate platform purchases.

Our current customers are specialists in media buying or advertising agencies or media agencies. These companies are in the midst of a transformation where the focus is more on the teams dealing with the commercialization/negotiation of the purchase of a media plan than on the optimization of the choice of the communication support, which results in a loss of expertise in the construction of a media plan. We also want to open our platform to users who are new to advertising.

In this context, the objective of this PhD is to propose and develop a recommendation engine based on dynamic machine learning in a big data context. The issues of transfer learning (homogeneous and heterogeneous) and veracity/value of the processing of massive data are in the core of this project.

Expected profile:

Information or mathematician with a Master oriented in data science, big data, data mining, or artificial intelligence. Knowledge and know-how in object programming (C #, Java, etc.), data analysis and related tools (R, weka, knime, etc.), database recommendation system (SQL, NoSQL, SPARQL) and / or in big data paradigms (Map / Reduce, Hadoop, Spark, Cloud) are desirable.

Scientific Supervisors:

¡¤ Cyril de Runz (Senior Lecturer (HDR), CReSTIC University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne)

¡¤ Amine A?t Younes (Senior Lecturer, CReSTIC University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne)

Industrial Supervisors:
